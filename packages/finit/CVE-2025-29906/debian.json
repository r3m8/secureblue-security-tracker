  "description": "Finit is a fast init for Linux systems. Versions starting from 3.0-rc1 and prior to version 4.11 bundle an implementation of getty for the `tty` configuration directive that can bypass `/bin/login`, i.e., a user can log in as any user without authentication. This issue has been patched in version 4.11.",
