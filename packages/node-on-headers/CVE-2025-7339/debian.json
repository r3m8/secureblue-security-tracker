  "description": "on-headers is a node.js middleware for listening to when a response writes headers. A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`.\u00a0Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch.\u00a0Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.",
