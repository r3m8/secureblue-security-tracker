  "description": "A privilege escalation from host to domain vulnerability was found in the FreeIPA project. The FreeIPA package fails to validate the uniqueness of the `krbCanonicalName` for the admin account by default, allowing users to create services with the same canonical name as the REALM admin. When a successful attack happens, the user can retrieve a Kerberos ticket in the name of this service, containing the admin@REALM credential. This flaw allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive data exfiltration.",
