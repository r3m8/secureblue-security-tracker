  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class  Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets dr->xprt to NULL, so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to provide the remote's address.  Unfortunately we can't revert the \"svc_deferred_class\" hunk in commit ece200ddd54b (\"sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in svc_xprt for trace events\") because there is now a specific check of event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning that check emits is:    event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1  A \"%pISpc\" format specifier with a \"struct sockaddr *\" is indeed flagged by this check.  Instead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address in the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event, and store that as a string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.  In the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad (\"tracing: Update print fmt check to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro\") is now in v5.18, so this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends properly during the v5.19 merge window.",
