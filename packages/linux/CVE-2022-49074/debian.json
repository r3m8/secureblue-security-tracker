  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3: Fix GICR_CTLR.RWP polling  It turns out that our polling of RWP is totally wrong when checking for it in the redistributors, as we test the *distributor* bit index, whereas it is a different bit number in the RDs... Oopsie boo.  This is embarassing. Not only because it is wrong, but also because it took *8 years* to notice the blunder...  Just fix the damn thing.",
