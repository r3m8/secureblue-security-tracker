  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM  The E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intel provides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final product design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static values defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design. Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe of the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:  WARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330 ... Call Trace:  <TASK>  ? __warn+0x83/0x130  ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330  ? report_bug+0x1b7/0x1d0  ? handle_bug+0x42/0x70  ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20  ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330  ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330  ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330  ice_dpll_get_pins.isra.0+0x52/0xe0 [ice] ...  The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected and defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.  Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL subsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.  Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on \"per HW design\" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically acquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for next-tree only.",
