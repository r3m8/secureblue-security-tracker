  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails  If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]), new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid memory leaks.  However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can lead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.  Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.
