  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: move bc link creation back to tipc_node_create  Shuang Li reported a NULL pointer dereference crash:    [] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000068   [] RIP: 0010:tipc_link_is_up+0x5/0x10 [tipc]   [] Call Trace:   []  <IRQ>   []  tipc_bcast_rcv+0xa2/0x190 [tipc]   []  tipc_node_bc_rcv+0x8b/0x200 [tipc]   []  tipc_rcv+0x3af/0x5b0 [tipc]   []  tipc_udp_recv+0xc7/0x1e0 [tipc]  It was caused by the 'l' passed into tipc_bcast_rcv() is NULL. When it creates a node in tipc_node_check_dest(), after inserting the new node into hashtable in tipc_node_create(), it creates the bc link. However, there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation, a bc packet may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference its bc link, which is NULL.  This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting into the hashtable.  Note that for a preliminary node becoming \"real\", the bc link creation should also be called before it's rehashed, as we don't create it for preliminary nodes.",
