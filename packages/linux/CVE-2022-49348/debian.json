  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state  The EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi->s_mount_state is used to indicate that we are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was actually a mistake, since the sbi->s_mount_info is initialized from es->s_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the name is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.  What should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag() inline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi->s_mount_flags.  The problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted superblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in s_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger a BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter out the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition away from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.",
