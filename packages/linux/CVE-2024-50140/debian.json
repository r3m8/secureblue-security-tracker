  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Disable page allocation in task_tick_mm_cid()  With KASAN and PREEMPT_RT enabled, calling task_work_add() in task_tick_mm_cid() may cause the following splat.  [   63.696416] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48 [   63.696416] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 610, name: modprobe [   63.696416] preempt_count: 10001, expected: 0 [   63.696416] RCU nest depth: 1, expected: 1  This problem is caused by the following call trace.    sched_tick() [ acquire rq->__lock ]    -> task_tick_mm_cid()     -> task_work_add()      -> __kasan_record_aux_stack()       -> kasan_save_stack()        -> stack_depot_save_flags()         -> alloc_pages_mpol_noprof()          -> __alloc_pages_noprof() \t  -> get_page_from_freelist() \t   -> rmqueue() \t    -> rmqueue_pcplist() \t     -> __rmqueue_pcplist() \t      -> rmqueue_bulk() \t       -> rt_spin_lock()  The rq lock is a raw_spinlock_t. We can't sleep while holding it. IOW, we can't call alloc_pages() in stack_depot_save_flags().  The task_tick_mm_cid() function with its task_work_add() call was introduced by commit 223baf9d17f2 (\"sched: Fix performance regression introduced by mm_cid\") in v6.4 kernel.  Fortunately, there is a kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() variant that calls stack_depot_save_flags() while not allowing it to allocate new pages.  To allow task_tick_mm_cid() to use task_work without page allocation, a new TWAF_NO_ALLOC flag is added to enable calling kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() instead of kasan_record_aux_stack() if set. The task_tick_mm_cid() function is modified to add this new flag.  The possible downside is the missing stack trace in a KASAN report due to new page allocation required when task_work_add_noallloc() is called which should be rare.",
