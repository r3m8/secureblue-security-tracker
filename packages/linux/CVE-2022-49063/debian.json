For example, on device reset the driver frees the rmap right before allocating a new one (the splat above). Make rmap creation and freeing function symmetrical with {request,free}_irq() calls i.e. do that on ifup/ifdown instead of device probe/remove/resume. These operations can be performed independently from the actual device aRFS configuration. Also, make sure ice_vsi_free_irq() clears IRQ affinity notifiers only when aRFS is disabled -- otherwise, CPU rmap sets and clears its own and they must not be touched manually.",
