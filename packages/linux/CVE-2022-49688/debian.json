  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  afs: Fix dynamic root getattr  The recent patch to make afs_getattr consult the server didn't account for the pseudo-inodes employed by the dynamic root-type afs superblock not having a volume or a server to access, and thus an oops occurs if such a directory is stat'd.  Fix this by checking to see if the vnode->volume pointer actually points anywhere before following it in afs_getattr().  This can be tested by stat'ing a directory in /afs.  It may be sufficient just to do \"ls /afs\" and the oops looks something like:          BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020         ...
