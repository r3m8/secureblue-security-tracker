  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespace  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x640/0x6b0 Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880106fe400 by task repro/72= bpf_nf_link_release+0xda/0x1e0 bpf_link_free+0x139/0x2d0 bpf_link_release+0x68/0x80 __fput+0x414/0xb60  Eric says:  It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook()  after exit()/close() time.  Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been  dismantled/freed already.  bpf_nf_link_attach() does :  link->net = net;  But I do not see a reference being taken on net.  Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg. Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so I do not know if this resolves this splat.",
