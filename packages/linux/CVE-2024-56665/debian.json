  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf,perf: Fix invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_prog  Syzbot reported [1] crash that happens for following tracing scenario:    - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach it to the     process and set bpf program to it   - attached process forks -> chid creates inherited event      the new child event shares the parent's bpf program and tp_event     (hence prog_array) which is global for tracepoint    - exit both process and its child -> release both events   - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array     and second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because     tp_event->prog_array is NULL  The fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_array is valid before it tries to remove the bpf program from it.
