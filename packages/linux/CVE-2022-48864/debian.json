  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vdpa/mlx5: add validation for VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command  When control vq receives a VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command request from the driver, presently there is no validation against the number of queue pairs to configure, or even if multiqueue had been negotiated or not is unverified. This may lead to kernel panic due to uninitialized resource for the queues were there any bogus request sent down by untrusted driver. Tie up the loose ends there.",
