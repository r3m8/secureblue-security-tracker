  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: arm_scpi: Ensure scpi_info is not assigned if the probe fails  When scpi probe fails, at any point, we need to ensure that the scpi_info is not set and will remain NULL until the probe succeeds. If it is not taken care, then it could result use-after-free as the value is exported via get_scpi_ops() and could refer to a memory allocated via devm_kzalloc() but freed when the probe fails.",
