  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/type1: prevent underflow of locked_vm via exec()  When a vfio container is preserved across exec, the task does not change, but it gets a new mm with locked_vm=0, and loses the count from existing dma mappings.  If the user later unmaps a dma mapping, locked_vm underflows to a large unsigned value, and a subsequent dma map request fails with ENOMEM in __account_locked_vm.  To avoid underflow, grab and save the mm at the time a dma is mapped. Use that mm when adjusting locked_vm, rather than re-acquiring the saved task's mm, which may have changed.  If the saved mm is dead, do nothing.  locked_vm is incremented for existing mappings in a subsequent patch.",
