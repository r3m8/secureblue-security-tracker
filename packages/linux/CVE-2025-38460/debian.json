  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm: clip: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd().  atmarpd is protected by RTNL since commit f3a0592b37b8 (\"[ATM]: clip causes unregister hang\").  However, it is not enough because to_atmarpd() is called without RTNL, especially clip_neigh_solicit() / neigh_ops->solicit() is unsleepable.  Also, there is no RTNL dependency around atmarpd.  Let's use a private mutex and RCU to protect access to atmarpd in to_atmarpd().",
