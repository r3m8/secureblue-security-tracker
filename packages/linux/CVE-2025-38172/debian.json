  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type  For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be regular files.  However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK, which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that leads to an UAF:    erofs_fc_get_tree     get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)       erofs_read_superblock         erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,                            // return -ENOTBLK       deactivate_locked_super         free(sbi)     if (err is -ENOTBLK)       sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF  So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the primary device must be a block device, and the extra device is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.",
