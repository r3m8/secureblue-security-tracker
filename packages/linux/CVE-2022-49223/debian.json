  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/port: Hold port reference until decoder release  KASAN + DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE reports a potential use-after-free in cxl_decoder_release() where it goes to reference its parent, a cxl_port, to free its id back to port->decoder_ida.
