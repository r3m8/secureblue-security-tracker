  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at removal  The USB-audio MIDI code initializes the timer, but in a rare case, the driver might be freed without the disconnect call.  This leaves the timer in an active state while the assigned object is released via snd_usbmidi_free(), which ends up with a kernel warning when the debug configuration is enabled, as spotted by fuzzer.  For avoiding the problem, put timer_shutdown_sync() at snd_usbmidi_free(), so that the timer can be killed properly. While we're at it, replace the existing timer_delete_sync() at the disconnect callback with timer_shutdown_sync(), too.",
