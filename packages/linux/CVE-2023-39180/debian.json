  "description": "A flaw was found within the handling of SMB2_READ commands in the kernel ksmbd module. The issue results from not releasing memory after its effective lifetime. An attacker can leverage this to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Linux. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, but only systems with ksmbd enabled are vulnerable.",
