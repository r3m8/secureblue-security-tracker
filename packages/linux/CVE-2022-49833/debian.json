  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: clone zoned device info when cloning a device  When cloning a btrfs_device, we're not cloning the associated btrfs_zoned_device_info structure of the device in case of a zoned filesystem.  Later on this leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the device's zone_info for instance when setting a zone as active.  This was uncovered by fstests' testcase btrfs/161.",
