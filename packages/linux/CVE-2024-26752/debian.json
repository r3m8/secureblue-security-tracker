  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  l2tp: pass correct message length to ip6_append_data  l2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs to avoid accounting for the transport header twice when splicing more data into an already partially-occupied skbuff.  To manage this, we check whether the skbuff contains data using skb_queue_empty when deciding how much data to append using ip6_append_data.  However, the code which performed the calculation was incorrect:       ulen = len + skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0;  ...due to C operator precedence, this ends up setting ulen to transhdrlen for messages with a non-zero length, which results in corrupted packets on the wire.  Add parentheses to correct the calculation in line with the original intent.",
