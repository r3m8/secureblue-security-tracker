  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  srcu: Tighten cleanup_srcu_struct() GP checks  Currently, cleanup_srcu_struct() checks for a grace period in progress, but it does not check for a grace period that has not yet started but which might start at any time.  Such a situation could result in a use-after-free bug, so this commit adds a check for a grace period that is needed but not yet started to cleanup_srcu_struct().",
