  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes  Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many writes can cause soft lockup.  Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for raid10 with ramdisks:  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#10 stuck for 27s! [md0_raid10:1293] Call Trace:  <TASK>  call_rcu+0x16/0x20  put_object+0x41/0x80  __delete_object+0x50/0x90  delete_object_full+0x2b/0x40  kmemleak_free+0x46/0xa0  slab_free_freelist_hook.constprop.0+0xed/0x1a0  kmem_cache_free+0xfd/0x300  mempool_free_slab+0x1f/0x30  mempool_free+0x3a/0x100  bio_free+0x59/0x80  bio_put+0xcf/0x2c0  free_r10bio+0xbf/0xf0  raid_end_bio_io+0x78/0xb0  one_write_done+0x8a/0xa0  raid10_end_write_request+0x1b4/0x430  bio_endio+0x175/0x320  brd_submit_bio+0x3b9/0x9b7 [brd]  __submit_bio+0x69/0xe0  submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x1e6/0x5a0  submit_bio_noacct+0x38c/0x7e0  flush_pending_writes+0xf0/0x240  raid10d+0xac/0x1ed0  Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.  Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example, in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.",
