  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ctnetlink: remove refcounting in expectation dumpers  Same pattern as previous patch: do not keep the expectation object alive via refcount, only store a cookie value and then use that as the skip hint for dump resumption.  AFAICS this has the same issue as the one resolved in the conntrack dumper, when we do   if (!refcount_inc_not_zero(&exp->use))  to increment the refcount, there is a chance that exp == last, which causes a double-increment of the refcount and subsequent memory leak.",
