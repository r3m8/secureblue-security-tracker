  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ena: fix shift-out-of-bounds in exponential backoff  The ENA adapters on our instances occasionally reset.  Once recently logged a UBSAN failure to console in the process:    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in build/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/amazon/ena/ena_com.c:540:13   shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'   CPU: 28 PID: 70012 Comm: kworker/u72:2 Kdump: loaded not tainted 5.15.117   Hardware name: Amazon EC2 c5d.9xlarge/, BIOS 1.0 10/16/2017   Workqueue: ena ena_fw_reset_device [ena]   Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x4a/0x63   dump_stack+0x10/0x16   ubsan_epilogue+0x9/0x36   __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds.cold+0x61/0x10e   ? __const_udelay+0x43/0x50   ena_delay_exponential_backoff_us.cold+0x16/0x1e [ena]   wait_for_reset_state+0x54/0xa0 [ena]   ena_com_dev_reset+0xc8/0x110 [ena]   ena_down+0x3fe/0x480 [ena]   ena_destroy_device+0xeb/0xf0 [ena]   ena_fw_reset_device+0x30/0x50 [ena]   process_one_work+0x22b/0x3d0   worker_thread+0x4d/0x3f0   ? process_one_work+0x3d0/0x3d0   kthread+0x12a/0x150   ? set_kthread_struct+0x50/0x50   ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30   </TASK>  Apparently, the reset delays are getting so large they can trigger a UBSAN panic.  Looking at the code, the current timeout is capped at 5000us.  Using a base value of 100us, the current code will overflow after (1<<29).  Even at values before 32, this function wraps around, perhaps unintentionally.  Cap the value of the exponent used for this backoff at (1<<16) which is larger than currently necessary, but large enough to support bigger values in the future.",
