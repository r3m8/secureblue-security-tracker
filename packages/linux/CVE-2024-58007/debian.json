  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number  On MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does not change across individual devices. It's always:    db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number   2644893864  The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916 devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo struct in SMEM.  Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the field is also taken into account.",
