  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: improve size validations for received domain records  The function tipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and process domain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of the network topology.  This patch verifies that the number of members in a received domain record does not exceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN, something that may otherwise lead to a stack overflow.  tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the function tipc_link_proto_rcv(), where we are reading a 32 bit message data length field into a uint16.  To avert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extra sanity check for this in that function.  We cannot see that happen with the current code, but future designers being unaware of this risk, may introduce it by allowing delivery of very large (> 64k) sk buffers from the bearer layer.  This potential problem was identified by Eric Dumazet.  This fixes CVE-2022-0435",
