  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: mediatek: mt8183: Add back SSPM related clocks  This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.  On the MT8183, the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space for all the clocks defined in the clock driver, not the highest index in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption, leading to crashes in unrelated areas, or nothing at all. KASAN will detect them.  Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management co-processor, and should never be turned off. They are marked as such.",
