  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix disable_otg_wa logic  [Why] When switching to another HDMI mode, we are unnecesarilly disabling/enabling FIFO causing both HPO and DIG registers to be set at the same time when only HPO is supposed to be set.  This can lead to a system hang the next time we change refresh rates as there are cases when we don't disable OTG/FIFO but FIFO is enabled when it isn't supposed to be.  [How] Removing the enable/disable FIFO entirely.",
