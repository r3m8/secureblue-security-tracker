  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables: avoid skb access on nf_stolen  When verdict is NF_STOLEN, the skb might have been freed.  When tracing is enabled, this can result in a use-after-free: 1. access to skb->nf_trace 2. access to skb->mark 3. computation of trace id 4. dump of packet payload  To avoid 1, keep a cached copy of skb->nf_trace in the trace state struct. Refresh this copy whenever verdict is != STOLEN.  Avoid 2 by skipping skb->mark access if verdict is STOLEN.  3 is avoided by precomputing the trace id.  Only dump the packet when verdict is not \"STOLEN\".",
