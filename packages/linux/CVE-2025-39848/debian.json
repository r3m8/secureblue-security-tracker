  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: properly unshare skbs in ax25_kiss_rcv()  Bernard Pidoux reported a regression apparently caused by commit c353e8983e0d (\"net: introduce per netns packet chains\").  skb->dev becomes NULL and we crash in __netif_receive_skb_core().  Before above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions could happen without a major crash.  But the root cause is that ax25_kiss_rcv() can queue/mangle input skb without checking if this skb is shared or not.  Many thanks to Bernard Pidoux for his help, diagnosis and tests.  We had a similar issue years ago fixed with commit 7aaed57c5c28 (\"phonet: properly unshare skbs in phonet_rcv()\").",
