  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak due to multiple rx_stats allocation  rx_stats for each arsta is allocated when adding a station. arsta->rx_stats will be freed when a station is removed.  Redundant allocations are occurring when the same station is added multiple times. This causes ath12k_mac_station_add() to be called multiple times, and rx_stats is allocated each time. As a result there is memory leaks.  Prevent multiple allocations of rx_stats when ath12k_mac_station_add() is called repeatedly by checking if rx_stats is already allocated before allocating again. Allocate arsta->rx_stats if arsta->rx_stats is NULL respectively.
