  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: fnic: Fix crash in fnic_wq_cmpl_handler when FDMI times out  When both the RHBA and RPA FDMI requests time out, fnic reuses a frame to send ABTS for each of them. On send completion, this causes an attempt to free the same frame twice that leads to a crash.  Fix crash by allocating separate frames for RHBA and RPA, and modify ABTS logic accordingly.  Tested by checking MDS for FDMI information.  Tested by using instrumented driver to:   - Drop PLOGI response  - Drop RHBA response  - Drop RPA response  - Drop RHBA and RPA response  - Drop PLOGI response + ABTS response  - Drop RHBA response + ABTS response  - Drop RPA response + ABTS response  - Drop RHBA and RPA response + ABTS response for both of them",
