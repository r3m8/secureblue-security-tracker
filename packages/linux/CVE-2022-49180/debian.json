  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LSM: general protection fault in legacy_parse_param  The usual LSM hook \"bail on fail\" scheme doesn't work for cases where a security module may return an error code indicating that it does not recognize an input.  In this particular case Smack sees a mount option that it recognizes, and returns 0. A call to a BPF hook follows, which returns -ENOPARAM, which confuses the caller because Smack has processed its data.  The SELinux hook incorrectly returns 1 on success. There was a time when this was correct, however the current expectation is that it return 0 on success. This is repaired.",
