  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock  When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system to enter suspend status with below command: echo mem > /sys/power/state There will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as below: dwc3_suspend_common()     spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st     dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);         dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);             spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2nd This issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 (\"usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\") that removes the code of checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the following code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get the spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(\"usb: dwc3: Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") that forgot to remove the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume.",
