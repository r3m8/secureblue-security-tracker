  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements  Right now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in 'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get leaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(), papr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.  Also individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed 8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a NULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a 'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.  Fix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also include space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available events/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of indirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code can continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to iterate over the array and free up individual elements.",
