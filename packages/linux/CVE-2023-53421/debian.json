  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-cgroup: Reinit blkg_iostat_set after clearing in blkcg_reset_stats()  When blkg_alloc() is called to allocate a blkcg_gq structure with the associated blkg_iostat_set's, there are 2 fields within blkg_iostat_set that requires proper initialization - blkg & sync. The former field was introduced by commit 3b8cc6298724 (\"blk-cgroup: Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()\") while the later one was introduced by commit f73316482977 (\"blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using cgroup rstat\").  Unfortunately those fields in the blkg_iostat_set's are not properly re-initialized when they are cleared in v1's blkcg_reset_stats(). This can lead to a kernel panic due to NULL pointer access of the blkg pointer. The missing initialization of sync is less problematic and can be a problem in a debug kernel due to missing lockdep initialization.  Fix these problems by re-initializing them after memory clearing.",
