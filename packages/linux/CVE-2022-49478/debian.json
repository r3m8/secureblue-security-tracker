  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: pvrusb2: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in pvr2_i2c_core_init  Syzbot reported that -1 is used as array index. The problem was in missing validation check.  hdw->unit_number is initialized with -1 and then if init table walk fails this value remains unchanged. Since code blindly uses this member for array indexing adding sanity check is the easiest fix for that.  hdw->workpoll initialization moved upper to prevent warning in __flush_work.",
