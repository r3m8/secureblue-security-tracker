  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()  There are actually 2 problems: - deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements   [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds. - The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last   element is out of bounds.  The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds element is part of an unmapped page.",
