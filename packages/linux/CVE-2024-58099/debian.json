  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame  Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.  If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped on the path.  vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp() through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:    page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);   tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +                   VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;   dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev,                              tbi->dma_addr, buf_size,                              DMA_TO_DEVICE);  The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP BPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is correct (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data - xdp->data_hard_start.",
