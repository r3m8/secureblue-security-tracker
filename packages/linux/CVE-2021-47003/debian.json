  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: idxd: Fix potential null dereference on pointer status  There are calls to idxd_cmd_exec that pass a null status pointer however a recent commit has added an assignment to *status that can end up with a null pointer dereference.  The function expects a null status pointer sometimes as there is a later assignment to *status where status is first null checked.  Fix the issue by null checking status before making the assignment.  Addresses-Coverity: (\"Explicit null dereferenced\")",
