  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory again  Since commit ebff7d8f270d (\"mem hotunplug: fix kfree() of bootmem memory\"), we could get a resource allocated during boot via alloc_resource().  And it's required to release the resource using free_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree directly which will result in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every call site, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.",
