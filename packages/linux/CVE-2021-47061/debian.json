  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync'ing SRCU  If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a device, wait to destroy the device until after all readers are guaranteed to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their reference of the bus to remain valid.",
