  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: fix reference counting for struct tpm_chip  The following sequence of operations results in a refcount warning:  1. Open device /dev/tpmrm. 2. Remove module tpm_tis_spi. 3.

Since commit 8979b02aaf1d (\"tpm: Fix reference count to main device\") the extra reference used to prevent a premature zero counter is never taken, because the required TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag is never set.  Fix this by moving the TPM 2 character device handling from tpm_chip_alloc() to tpm_add_char_device() which is called at a later point in time when the flag has been set in case of TPM2.  Commit fdc915f7f719 (\"tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm<n>\") already introduced function tpm_devs_release() to release the extra reference but did not implement the required put on chip->devs that results in the call of this function.  Fix this by putting chip->devs in tpm_chip_unregister().  Finally move the new implementation for the TPM 2 handling into a new function to avoid multiple checks for the TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag in the good case and error cases.",
