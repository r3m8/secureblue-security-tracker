  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: core: call put_device() only after device_register() fails  put_device() shouldn't be called before a prior call to device_register(). __thermal_cooling_device_register() doesn't follow that properly and needs fixing. Also thermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() is getting called unnecessarily on few error paths.  Fix all this by placing the calls at the right place.  Based on initial work done by Caleb Connolly.",
