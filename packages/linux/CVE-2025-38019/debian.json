  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix use-after-free when deleting GRE net devices  The driver only offloads neighbors that are constructed on top of net devices registered by it or their uppers (which are all Ethernet). The device supports GRE encapsulation and decapsulation of forwarded traffic, but the driver will not offload dummy neighbors constructed on top of GRE net devices as they are not uppers of its net devices:   # ip link add name gre1 up type gre tos inherit local 192.0.2.1 remote 198.51.100.1  # ip neigh add 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 nud noarp dev gre1  $ ip neigh show dev gre1 nud noarp  0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 NOARP  (Note that the neighbor is not marked with 'offload')  When the driver is reloaded and the existing configuration is replayed, the driver does not perform the same check regarding existing neighbors and offloads the previously added one:   # devlink dev reload pci/0000:01:00.0  $ ip neigh show dev gre1 nud noarp  0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 offload NOARP  If the neighbor is later deleted, the driver will ignore the notification (given the GRE net device is not its upper) and will therefore keep referencing freed memory, resulting in a use-after-free [1] when the net device is deleted:   # ip neigh del 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 dev gre1  # ip link del dev gre1  Fix by skipping neighbor replay if the net device for which the replay is performed is not our upper.
