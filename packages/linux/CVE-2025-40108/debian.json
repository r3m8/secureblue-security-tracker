  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: qcom-geni: Fix blocked task  Revert commit 1afa70632c39 (\"serial: qcom-geni: Enable PM runtime for serial driver\") and its dependent commit 86fa39dd6fb7 (\"serial: qcom-geni: Enable Serial on SA8255p Qualcomm platforms\") because the first one causes regression - hang task on Qualcomm RB1 board (QRB2210) and unable to use serial at all during normal boot:    INFO: task kworker/u16:0:12 blocked for more than 42 seconds.

Only after complaining author produced a fix which did not work, so if original commits cannot be reliably fixed for 5 weeks, they obviously are buggy and need to be dropped.",
