  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work  The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started. The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the work item currently in the work queue.  However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case, cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).  Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.",
