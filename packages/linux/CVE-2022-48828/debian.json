  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Fix ia_size underflow  iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and NFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there is a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is already larger than Linux can handle.  Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size underflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let's catch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().",
