  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Fix peer lookup in ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu()  In ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu(), peer lookup fails because rxcb->peer_id is not updated with a valid value. This is expected in monitor mode, where RX frames bypass the regular RX descriptor path that typically sets rxcb->peer_id. As a result, the peer is NULL, and link_id and link_valid fields in the RX status are not populated. This leads to a WARN_ON in mac80211 when it receives data frame from an associated station with invalid link_id.  Fix this potential issue by using ppduinfo->peer_id, which holds the correct peer id for the received frame. This ensures that the peer is correctly found and the associated link metadata is updated accordingly.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
