  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  batman-adv: fix panic during interface removal  Reference counting is used to ensure that batadv_hardif_neigh_node and batadv_hard_iface are not freed before/during batadv_v_elp_throughput_metric_update work is finished.  But there isn't a guarantee that the hard if will remain associated with a soft interface up until the work is finished.  This fixes a crash triggered by reboot that looks like this:  Call trace:  batadv_v_mesh_free+0xd0/0x4dc [batman_adv]  batadv_v_elp_throughput_metric_update+0x1c/0xa4  process_one_work+0x178/0x398  worker_thread+0x2e8/0x4d0  kthread+0xd8/0xdc  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  (the batadv_v_mesh_free call is misleading, and does not actually happen)  I was able to make the issue happen more reliably by changing hardif_neigh->bat_v.metric_work work to be delayed work. This allowed me to track down and confirm the fix.  [sven@narfation.org: prevent entering batadv_v_elp_get_throughput without  soft_iface]",
