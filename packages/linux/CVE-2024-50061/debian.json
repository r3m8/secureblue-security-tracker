  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition  In the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with cdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call cnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work.  If we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                      CPU1                                       | cdns_i3c_master_hj cdns_i3c_master_remove               | i3c_master_unregister(&master->base) | device_unregister(&master->dev)      | device_release                       | //free master->base                  |                                      | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)                                      | //use master->base  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.",
