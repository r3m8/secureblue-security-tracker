  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  eventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion  Ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than EP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.  Currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:   - They don't look upwards in the tree.  - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of    the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit    28d82dc1c4ed (\"epoll: limit paths\").  Essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.  A more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5 edges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.  As a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500, tested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (\"eventpoll: Fix priority inversion problem\").)  To fix it:  1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node, and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree has already been visited. 2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum depth of an upwards walk. 3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length between epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.",
