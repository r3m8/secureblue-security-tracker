  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()  In aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently only call sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to the following problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:  1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display 2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so    sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources    are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() 3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable() 4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources    have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when    it was called by the other device.  Fix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking the device to determine if we should execute it or not.  v2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set v3: Move device check into the mutex     Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()     Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()",
