  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/resctrl: Clear staged_config[] before and after it is used  As a temporary storage, staged_config[] in rdt_domain should be cleared before and after it is used. The stale value in staged_config[] could cause an MSR access error.  Here is a reproducer on a system with 16 usable CLOSIDs for a 15-way L3 Cache (MBA should be disabled if the number of CLOSIDs for MB is less than 16.) : \tmount -t resctrl resctrl -o cdp /sys/fs/resctrl \tmkdir /sys/fs/resctrl/p{1..7} \tumount /sys/fs/resctrl/ \tmount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl \tmkdir /sys/fs/resctrl/p{1..8}  An error occurs when creating resource group named p8:     unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xca0 (tried to write 0x00000000000007ff) at rIP: 0xffffffff82249142 (cat_wrmsr+0x32/0x60)     Call Trace:      <IRQ>      __flush_smp_call_function_queue+0x11d/0x170      __sysvec_call_function+0x24/0xd0      sysvec_call_function+0x89/0xc0      </IRQ>      <TASK>      asm_sysvec_call_function+0x16/0x20  When creating a new resource control group, hardware will be configured by the following process:     rdtgroup_mkdir()       rdtgroup_mkdir_ctrl_mon()         rdtgroup_init_alloc()           resctrl_arch_update_domains()  resctrl_arch_update_domains() iterates and updates all resctrl_conf_type whose have_new_ctrl is true. Since staged_config[] holds the same values as when CDP was enabled, it will continue to update the CDP_CODE and CDP_DATA configurations. When group p8 is created, get_config_index() called in resctrl_arch_update_domains() will return 16 and 17 as the CLOSIDs for CDP_CODE and CDP_DATA, which will be translated to an invalid register - 0xca0 in this scenario.  Fix it by clearing staged_config[] before and after it is used.  [reinette: re-order commit tags]",
