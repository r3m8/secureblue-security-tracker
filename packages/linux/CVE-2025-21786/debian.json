  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool  The commit 68f83057b913(\"workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and remove detach_completion\") adds code to reap the normal workers but mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting for the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug reported by Cheung Wall.  To avoid the use-after-free bug, the pool\u2019s reference must be held until the detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool.",
