But this function is not guaranteed the work is the last queued. So, the destroyed instance may be accessed in the work which will try to enqueue later.  In order to completely fix, we re-order the calling of cancel_work_sync() to make sure the work tipc_net_finalize_work() was last queued and it must be completed by calling cancel_work_sync().",
