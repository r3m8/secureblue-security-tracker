  "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue \u201cis a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.\u201d",
