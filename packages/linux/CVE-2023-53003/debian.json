  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/qcom: Do not pass llcc_driv_data as edac_device_ctl_info's pvt_info  The memory for llcc_driv_data is allocated by the LLCC driver. But when it is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC core, it will get freed during the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver gets probed again, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug.  Hence, do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it using the platform_data pointer in the qcom_edac driver.",
