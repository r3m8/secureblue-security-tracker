  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  start_kernel: Add __no_stack_protector function attribute  Back during the discussion of commit a9a3ed1eff36 (\"x86: Fix early boot crash on gcc-10, third try\") we discussed the need for a function attribute to control the omission of stack protectors on a per-function basis; at the time Clang had support for no_stack_protector but GCC did not. This was fixed in gcc-11. Now that the function attribute is available, let's start using it.  Callers of boot_init_stack_canary need to use this function attribute unless they're compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise the canary stored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to boot_init_stack_canary. This will lead to a call to __stack_chk_fail() then panic.",
