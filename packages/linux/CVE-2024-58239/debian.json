  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA  If we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of the same type still on the queue, we will end up merging them:  - process_rx_list copies the non-DATA record  - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's    of the same type  - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA  Just check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list did some work.",
