  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue  A patch to resolve an issue was found in MediaTek's GPL-licensed SDK: In the mtk_ppe_stop() function, the PPE scan mode is not disabled before disabling the PPE. This can potentially lead to a hang during the process of disabling the PPE.  Without this patch, the PPE may experience a hang during the reboot test.",
