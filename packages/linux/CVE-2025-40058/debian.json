  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk  Dirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit in the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging- structure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In another word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking doesn't work.  The Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 \"Snoop Behavior\" states:  \"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits  in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-  recoverable fault.\"  To prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page tracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as supported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.",
