  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Add schedule points in batch ops  syzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations.   INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds.  INFO: task hung in rcu_barrier  Nothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data, we need to add schedule points in them.  Note that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls from generic_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by moving the call after the loop.  This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged, unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.",
