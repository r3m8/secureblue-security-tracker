  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache  This change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and it solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.  Currently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed from the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that hugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated instead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states, this is effectively memory corruption.  The fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to use a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with EIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page, the thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.  [1]: commit a76054266661 (\"mm: shmem: don't truncate page if memory failure happens\")",
