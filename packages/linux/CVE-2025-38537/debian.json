  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy  If a PHY has no driver, the genphy driver is probed/removed directly in phy_attach/detach. If the PHY's ofnode has an \"leds\" subnode, then the LEDs will be (un)registered when probing/removing the genphy driver. This could occur if the leds are for a non-generic driver that isn't loaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in phy_detach leads to the following deadlock:  rtnl_lock() ndo_close()     ...     phy_detach()         phy_remove()             phy_leds_unregister()                 led_classdev_unregister()                     led_trigger_set()                         netdev_trigger_deactivate()                             unregister_netdevice_notifier()                                 rtnl_lock()  There is a corresponding deadlock on the open/register side of things (and that one is reported by lockdep), but it requires a race while this one is deterministic.  Generic PHYs do not support LEDs anyway, so don't bother registering them.",
