  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptp: ocp: fix use-after-free bugs causing by ptp_ocp_watchdog  The ptp_ocp_detach() only shuts down the watchdog timer if it is pending. However, if the timer handler is already running, the timer_delete_sync() is not called. This leads to race conditions where the devlink that contains the ptp_ocp is deallocated while the timer handler is still accessing it, resulting in use-after-free bugs. The following details one of the race scenarios.  (thread 1)                           | (thread 2) ptp_ocp_remove()                     |   ptp_ocp_detach()                   | ptp_ocp_watchdog()     if (timer_pending(&bp->watchdog))|   bp = timer_container_of()       timer_delete_sync()            |                                      |   devlink_free(devlink) //free       |                                      |   bp-> //use  Resolve this by unconditionally calling timer_delete_sync() to ensure the timer is reliably deactivated, preventing any access after free.",
