  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails  Currently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(), the tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding TID is not actually allocated. Proceed to ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid, which might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential crash or out-of-bounds access.  Hence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only the successfully allocated TIDs.  Also, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(), as decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.  Compile tested only.",
