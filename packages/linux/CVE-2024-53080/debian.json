  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor: Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM  Similar to commit cac075706f29 (\"drm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object\") we need to use the XArray's internal locking when retrieving a vm pointer from there.  v2: Removed part of the patch that was trying to protect fetching the heap pointer from XArray, as that operation is protected by the @pool->lock.",
