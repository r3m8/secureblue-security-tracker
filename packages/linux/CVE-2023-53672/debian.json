  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref  [BUG] Syzbot reported several warning triggered inside lookup_inline_extent_backref().  [CAUSE] As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e. inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already exist)  [ENHANCEMENT] After the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree leaf to help debug.",
