  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc  As described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case).  This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the reentrant case.
