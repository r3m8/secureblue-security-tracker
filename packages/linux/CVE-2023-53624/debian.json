  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of \"credit\"  if sch_fq is configured with \"initial quantum\" having values greater than INT_MAX, the first assignment of \"credit\" does signed integer overflow to a very negative value. In this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop, but \"credit\" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow. Capping \"initial quantum\" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.  v2: validation of \"initial quantum\" is done in fq_policy, instead of open     coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski",
