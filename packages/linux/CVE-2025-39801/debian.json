  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts  This commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeout which causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabled and unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled. It is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases. The following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:  1. Connect    ======= ->dwc3_thread_interrupt  ->dwc3_ep0_interrupt   ->configfs_composite_setup    ->composite_setup     ->usb_ep_queue      ->dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue       ->__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue        ->__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data         ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd  2. Disconnect    ========== ->dwc3_thread_interrupt  ->dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt   ->dwc3_ep0_reset_state    ->dwc3_ep0_end_control_data     ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd  In the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that control transfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and end transfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence and processing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout. This maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EP commands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better to remove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to avoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn.",
