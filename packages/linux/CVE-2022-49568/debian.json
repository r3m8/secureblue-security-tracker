  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy  A KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks: 1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed; 2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.  Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices (XICS, XIVE, XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during the machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device() assumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as discovered by Syzkaller.  This adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().  This is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined release() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.",
