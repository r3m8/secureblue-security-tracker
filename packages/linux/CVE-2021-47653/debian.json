  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: davinci: vpif: fix use-after-free on driver unbind  The driver allocates and registers two platform device structures during probe, but the devices were never deregistered on driver unbind.  This results in a use-after-free on driver unbind as the device structures were allocated using devres and would be freed by driver core when remove() returns.  Fix this by adding the missing deregistration calls to the remove() callback and failing probe on registration errors.  Note that the platform device structures must be freed using a proper release callback to avoid leaking associated resources like device names.",
