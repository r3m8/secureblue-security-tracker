  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: fix race between xmit and reset  There is a race between reset and the transmit paths that can lead to ibmvnic_xmit() accessing an scrq after it has been freed in the reset path. It can result in a crash like:  \tKernel attempted to read user page (0) - exploit attempt?

However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight ibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is progressing.  Since the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which can then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).  We cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the ->resetting bit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the \"back-end\" of a good reset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the ->resetting bit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to ->resetting being true, the queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit timeouts.  IOW ->resetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag that indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/ reset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx() and others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.  So we will have: \tA. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()  \t\t->resetting = true \t\t->tx_queues_active = false \t\tdisable tx queues \t\t... \t\t->tx_queues_active = true \t\tstart tx queues  \tB. Tx interrupt in ibmvnic_complete_tx():  \t\tif (->tx_queues_active) \t\t\tnetif_wake_subqueue();  To ensure that ->tx_queues_active and state of the queues are consistent, we need a lock which:  \t- must also be taken in the interrupt path (ibmvnic_complete_tx()) \t- shared across the multiple ---truncated---",
