  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing test for nilfs2.  The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.  If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled, nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.  Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().  The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",
