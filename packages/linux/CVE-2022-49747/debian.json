  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs/zmap.c: Fix incorrect offset calculation  Effective offset to add to length was being incorrectly calculated, which resulted in iomap->length being set to 0, triggering a WARN_ON in iomap_iter_done().  Fix that, and describe it in comments.  This was reported as a crash by syzbot under an issue about a warning encountered in iomap_iter_done(), but unrelated to erofs.
