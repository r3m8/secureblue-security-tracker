  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered  Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL pointer when unbinding this driver: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/  The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.  At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():  \t\tif (cond && !cond(chip)) \t\t\tcontinue;  These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.  To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e. were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.",
