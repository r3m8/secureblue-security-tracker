  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: don't set up encryption key during jbd2 transaction  Commit a80f7fcf1867 (\"ext4: fixup ext4_fc_track_* functions' signature\") extended the scope of the transaction in ext4_unlink() too far, making it include the call to ext4_find_entry().  However, ext4_find_entry() can deadlock when called from within a transaction because it may need to set up the directory's encryption key.  Fix this by restoring the transaction to its original scope.",
