  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()  In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.  The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.  Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.",
