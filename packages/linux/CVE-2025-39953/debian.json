  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cgroup: split cgroup_destroy_wq into 3 workqueues  A hung task can occur during [1] LTP cgroup testing when repeatedly mounting/unmounting perf_event and net_prio controllers with systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1. The hang manifests in cgroup_lock_and_drain_offline() during root destruction.  Related case: cgroup_fj_function_perf_event cgroup_fj_function.sh perf_event cgroup_fj_function_net_prio cgroup_fj_function.sh net_prio  Call Trace: \tcgroup_lock_and_drain_offline+0x14c/0x1e8 \tcgroup_destroy_root+0x3c/0x2c0 \tcss_free_rwork_fn+0x248/0x338 \tprocess_one_work+0x16c/0x3b8 \tworker_thread+0x22c/0x3b0 \tkthread+0xec/0x100 \tret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  Root Cause:  CPU0                            CPU1 mount perf_event                umount net_prio cgroup1_get_tree                cgroup_kill_sb rebind_subsystems               // root destruction enqueues \t\t\t\t// cgroup_destroy_wq // kill all perf_event css                                 // one perf_event css A is dying                                 // css A offline enqueues cgroup_destroy_wq                                 // root destruction will be executed first                                 css_free_rwork_fn                                 cgroup_destroy_root                                 cgroup_lock_and_drain_offline                                 // some perf descendants are dying                                 // cgroup_destroy_wq max_active = 1                                 // waiting for css A to die  Problem scenario: 1. CPU0 mounts perf_event (rebind_subsystems) 2. CPU1 unmounts net_prio (cgroup_kill_sb), queuing root destruction work 3. A dying perf_event CSS gets queued for offline after root destruction 4. Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is    blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)  Solution: Split cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues: cgroup_offline_wq \u2013 Handles CSS offline operations cgroup_release_wq \u2013 Manages resource release cgroup_free_wq \u2013 Performs final memory deallocation  This separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for offline operations to complete.
