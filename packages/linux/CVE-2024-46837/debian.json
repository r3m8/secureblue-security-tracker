  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_create  We were allowing any users to create a high priority group without any permission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of service.  We now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE capability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.  As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of MEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.  Additionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level, panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.
