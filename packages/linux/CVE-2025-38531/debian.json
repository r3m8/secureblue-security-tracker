  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: common: st_sensors: Fix use of uninitialize device structs  Throughout the various probe functions &indio_dev->dev is used before it is initialized. This caused a kernel panic in st_sensors_power_enable() when the call to devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable() fails and then calls dev_err_probe() with the uninitialized device.  This seems to only cause a panic with dev_err_probe(), dev_err(), dev_warn() and dev_info() don't seem to cause a panic, but are fixed as well.  The issue is reported and traced here: [1]",
