  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  driver core: Fix wait_for_device_probe() & deferred_probe_timeout interaction  Mounting NFS rootfs was timing out when deferred_probe_timeout was non-zero [1].  This was because ip_auto_config() initcall times out waiting for the network interfaces to show up when deferred_probe_timeout was non-zero. While ip_auto_config() calls wait_for_device_probe() to make sure any currently running deferred probe work or asynchronous probe finishes, that wasn't sufficient to account for devices being deferred until deferred_probe_timeout.  Commit 35a672363ab3 (\"driver core: Ensure wait_for_device_probe() waits until the deferred_probe_timeout fires\") tried to fix that by making sure wait_for_device_probe() waits for deferred_probe_timeout to expire before returning.  However, if wait_for_device_probe() is called from the kernel_init() context:  - Before deferred_probe_initcall() [2], it causes the boot process to   hang due to a deadlock.  - After deferred_probe_initcall() [3], it blocks kernel_init() from   continuing till deferred_probe_timeout expires and beats the point of   deferred_probe_timeout that's trying to wait for userspace to load   modules.  Neither of this is good. So revert the changes to wait_for_device_probe().
