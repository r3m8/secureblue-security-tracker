  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread  In case a malicious initiator sends some random data immediately after a login PDU; the iscsi_target_sk_data_ready() callback will schedule the login_work and, at the same time, the negotiation may end without clearing the LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag (because no additional PDU exchanges are required to complete the login).  The login has been completed but the login_work function will find the LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag set and will never stop from rescheduling itself; at this point, if the initiator drops the connection, the iscsit_conn structure will be freed, login_work will dereference a released socket structure and the kernel crashes.  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000230 PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page Workqueue: events iscsi_target_do_login_rx [iscsi_target_mod] RIP: 0010:_raw_read_lock_bh+0x15/0x30 Call trace:  iscsi_target_do_login_rx+0x75/0x3f0 [iscsi_target_mod]  process_one_work+0x1e8/0x3c0  Fix this bug by forcing login_work to stop after the login has been completed and the socket callbacks have been restored.  Add a comment to clearify the return values of iscsi_target_do_login()",
