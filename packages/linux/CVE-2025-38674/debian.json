  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"drm/prime: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance\"  This reverts commit f83a9b8c7fd0557b0c50784bfdc1bbe9140c9bf8.  The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted in a NULL-pointer deref.  Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 (\"drm/gem: Acquire references on GEM handles for framebuffers\") and commit f6bfc9afc751 (\"drm/framebuffer: Acquire internal references on GEM handles\") only solved the problem partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM framebuffer associated.  Hence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.  v3: - cc stable",
