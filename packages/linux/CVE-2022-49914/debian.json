  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()  During backref walking, at resolve_indirect_refs(), if we get an error we jump to the 'out' label and call ulist_free() on the 'parents' ulist, which frees all the elements in the ulist - however that does not free any inode lists that may be attached to elements, through the 'aux' field of a ulist node, so we end up leaking lists if we have any attached to the unodes.  Fix this by calling free_leaf_list() instead of ulist_free() when we exit from resolve_indirect_refs(). The static function free_leaf_list() is moved up for this to be possible and it's slightly simplified by removing unnecessary code.",
