  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key  Customers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with SMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:  task A                         task B cifs_mount()  dfs_mount_share()   get_session()    cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()     cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()      cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()       kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()                                    crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*  Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by checking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with @ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef (\"smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()\"), we made sure to call ->logoff() only when @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), so it's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.",
