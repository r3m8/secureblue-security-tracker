  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()  The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to races with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of these can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of the following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync() runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order to avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was missed in commit b5d91704f53e (\"libceph: behave in mon_fault() if cur_mon < 0\") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objects that hang off of it, with monc->auth and monc->monmap being particularly susceptible to quickly being reused.  To fix this:  - clear monc->cur_mon and monc->hunting as part of closing the session   in ceph_monc_stop() - bail from delayed_work() if monc->cur_mon is cleared, similar to how   it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc->hunting) - call cancel_delayed_work_sync() after the session is closed",
