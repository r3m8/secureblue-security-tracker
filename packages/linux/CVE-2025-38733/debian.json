  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/mm: Do not map lowcore with identity mapping  Since the identity mapping is pinned to address zero the lowcore is always also mapped to address zero, this happens regardless of the relocate_lowcore command line option. If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped twice, instead of only once.  This means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an exception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts). To fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the identity mapping.",
