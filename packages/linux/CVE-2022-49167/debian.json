  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: do not double complete bio on errors during compressed reads  I hit some weird panics while fixing up the error handling from btrfs_lookup_bio_sums().  Turns out the compression path will complete the bio we use if we set up any of the compression bios and then return an error, and then btrfs_submit_data_bio() will also call bio_endio() on the bio.  Fix this by making btrfs_submit_compressed_read() responsible for calling bio_endio() on the bio if there are any errors.  Currently it was only doing it if we created the compression bios, otherwise it was depending on btrfs_submit_data_bio() to do the right thing.  This creates the above problem, so fix up btrfs_submit_compressed_read() to always call bio_endio() in case of an error, and then simply return from btrfs_submit_data_bio() if we had to call btrfs_submit_compressed_read().",
