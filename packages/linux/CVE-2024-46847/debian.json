  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue  Commit 8c61291fd850 (\"mm: fix incorrect vbq reference in purge_fragmented_block\") extended the 'vmap_block' structure to contain a 'cpu' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialising CPU.  When a new 'vmap_block' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), the partially initialised structure is added to the local 'vmap_block_queue' xarray before the 'cpu' field has been initialised.  If another CPU is concurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it may perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an uninitialised index.  This has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:   | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP  |  | Call trace:  |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c  |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378  |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28  |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c  |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24  |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238  |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310  Move the initialisation of 'vb->cpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the addition to the xarray.",
