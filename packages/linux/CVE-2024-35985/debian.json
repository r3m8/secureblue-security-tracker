  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()  It was possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes a NULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returning falsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.  Specifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering the limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the scaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can overflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then causes the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing is eligible.  Thus limit the range of vlag accordingly.  All this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen.",
