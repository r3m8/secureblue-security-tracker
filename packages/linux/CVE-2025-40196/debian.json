  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: quota: create dedicated workqueue for quota_release_work  There is a kernel panic due to WARN_ONCE when panic_on_warn is set.  This issue occurs when writeback is triggered due to sync call for an opened file(ie, writeback reason is WB_REASON_SYNC). When f2fs balance is needed at sync path, flush for quota_release_work is triggered. By default quota_release_work is queued to \"events_unbound\" queue which does not have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag. During f2fs balance \"writeback\" workqueue tries to flush quota_release_work causing kernel panic due to MEM_RECLAIM flag mismatch errors.  This patch creates dedicated workqueue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for work quota_release_work.  ------------[ cut here ]------------ WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 14867 at kernel/workqueue.c:3721 check_flush_dependency+0x13c/0x148 Call trace:  check_flush_dependency+0x13c/0x148  __flush_work+0xd0/0x398  flush_delayed_work+0x44/0x5c  dquot_writeback_dquots+0x54/0x318  f2fs_do_quota_sync+0xb8/0x1a8  f2fs_write_checkpoint+0x3cc/0x99c  f2fs_gc+0x190/0x750  f2fs_balance_fs+0x110/0x168  f2fs_write_single_data_page+0x474/0x7dc  f2fs_write_data_pages+0x7d0/0xd0c  do_writepages+0xe0/0x2f4  __writeback_single_inode+0x44/0x4ac  writeback_sb_inodes+0x30c/0x538  wb_writeback+0xf4/0x440  wb_workfn+0x128/0x5d4  process_scheduled_works+0x1c4/0x45c  worker_thread+0x32c/0x3e8  kthread+0x11c/0x1b0  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 Kernel panic - not syncing: kernel: panic_on_warn set ...",
