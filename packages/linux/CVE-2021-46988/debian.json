  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON  Consider the following sequence of events:  1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into    shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we    shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return    -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated. 2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after    dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into    shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). 3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used. 4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and    immediately returns - without releasing the page.  This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the page should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.  To fix this, detect if we have such a \"dangling\" page when accounting fails, and if so, release it before returning.",
