  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: Log an error when close_all_cached_dirs fails  Under low-memory conditions, close_all_cached_dirs() can't move the dentries to a separate list to dput() them once the locks are dropped. This will result in a \"Dentry still in use\" error, so add an error message that makes it clear this is what happened:  [  495.281119] CIFS: VFS: \\\\otters.example.com\\share Out of memory while dropping dentries [  495.281595] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [  495.281887] BUG: Dentry ffff888115531138{i=78,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs] [  495.282391] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2329 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xc8/0xf0  Also, bail out of looping through all tcons as soon as a single allocation fails, since we're already in trouble, and kmalloc() attempts for subseqeuent tcons are likely to fail just like the first one did.",
