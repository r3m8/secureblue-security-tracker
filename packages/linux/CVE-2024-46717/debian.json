  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page release  Under the following conditions: 1) No skb created yet 2) header_size == 0 (no SHAMPO header) 3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the    last page fragment of a SHAMPO header page)  a new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (it is a regular data page). Further down in the same function (mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page from header_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO header pages being released more than once.",
