  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: fix soft lockup in status_resync  status_resync() will calculate 'curr_resync - recovery_active' to show user a progress bar like following:  [============>........]  resync = 61.4%  'curr_resync' and 'recovery_active' is updated in md_do_sync(), and status_resync() can read them concurrently, hence it's possible that 'curr_resync - recovery_active' can overflow to a huge number. In this case status_resync() will be stuck in the loop to print a large amount of '=', which will end up soft lockup.  Fix the problem by setting 'resync' to MD_RESYNC_ACTIVE in this case, this way resync in progress will be reported to user.",
