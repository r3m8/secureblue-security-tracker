  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts  This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:    A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux   kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on   `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing   between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`   global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or   potential code execution.  In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed.  This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",
