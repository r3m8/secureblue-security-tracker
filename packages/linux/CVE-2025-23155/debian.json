  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint  In stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi(), a pointer to the stack variable cpu_mask is passed to irq_set_affinity_hint(). This value is stored in irq_desc->affinity_hint, but once stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi() returns, the pointer becomes dangling.  The affinity_hint is exposed via procfs with S_IRUGO permissions, allowing any unprivileged process to read it. Accessing this stale pointer can lead to:  - a kernel oops or panic if the referenced memory has been released and   unmapped, or - leakage of kernel data into userspace if the memory is re-used for   other purposes.  All platforms that use stmmac with PCI MSI (Intel, Loongson, etc) are affected.",
