  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: n_gsm: add sanity check for gsm->receive in gsm_receive_buf()  A null pointer dereference can happen when attempting to access the \"gsm->receive()\" function in gsmld_receive_buf(). Currently, the code assumes that gsm->recieve is only called after MUX activation. Since the gsmld_receive_buf() function can be accessed without the need to initialize the MUX, the gsm->receive() function will not be set and a NULL pointer dereference will occur.  Fix this by avoiding the call to \"gsm->receive()\" in case the function is not initialized by adding a sanity check.
