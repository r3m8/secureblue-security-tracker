  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev: nvidiafb: Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow  Coverity complains of a possible buffer overflow. However, given the 'static' scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks like that can't happen after examiniing the call sites.  CID 19036 (#1 of 1): Copy into fixed size buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW) 1. fixed_size_dest: You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size string   chan->adapter.name by copying name without checking the length. 2. parameter_as_source: Note: This defect has an elevated risk because the   source argument is a parameter of the current function.  89        strcpy(chan->adapter.name, name);  Fix this warning by using strscpy() which will silence the warning and prevent any future buffer overflows should the names used to identify the channel become much longer.",
