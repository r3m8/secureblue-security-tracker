  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack\"  Currently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only called for confirmed conntrack entries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack entry does not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in ovs_ct_get_conn_labels() for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in nf_ct_ext_add():    WARN_ON(nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct));  This happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS increments net->ct.labels_used. The issue has become more likely since commit fcb1aa5163b1 (\"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack\"), which changed to use per-action label counting and increment net->ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.  Since there\u2019s no straightforward way to fully resolve this issue at the moment, this reverts the commit to avoid breaking existing use cases.",
