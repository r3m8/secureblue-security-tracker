  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()  It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully) returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory address.  Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted, otherwise report what was in that location.",
