  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: vt6655: fix some erroneous memory clean-up loops  In some initialization functions of this driver, memory is allocated with 'i' acting as an index variable and increasing from 0. The commit in \"Fixes\" introduces some clean-up codes in case of allocation failure, which free memory in reverse order with 'i' decreasing to 0. However, there are some problems:   - The case i=0 is left out. Thus memory is leaked.   - In case memory allocation fails right from the start, the memory     freeing loops will start with i=-1 and invalid memory locations will     be accessed.  One of these loops has been fixed in commit c8ff91535880 (\"staging: vt6655: fix potential memory leak\"). Fix the remaining erroneous loops.",
