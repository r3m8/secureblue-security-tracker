  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc: Fix virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit Book3E & 32-bit  mpe: On 64-bit Book3E vmalloc space starts at 0x8000000000000000.  Because of the way __pa() works we have:   __pa(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore   virt_to_pfn(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore   virt_addr_valid(0x8000000000000000) == true  Which is wrong, virt_addr_valid() should be false for vmalloc space. In fact all vmalloc addresses that alias with a valid PFN will return true from virt_addr_valid(). That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy as described below by Kefeng Wang:    When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:      usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!     kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99     ...     usercopy_abort+0x64/0xa0 (unreliable)     __check_heap_object+0x168/0x190     __check_object_size+0x1a0/0x200     dev_ethtool+0x2494/0x2b20     dev_ioctl+0x5d0/0x770     sock_do_ioctl+0xf0/0x1d0     sock_ioctl+0x3ec/0x5a0     __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160     system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0     system_call_common+0xf8/0x200    The code shows below,      data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));     copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))    The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true   on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.    As commit 4dd7554a6456 (\"powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va   and __pa addresses\") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in   the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make   sure the virt is below high_memory.    Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start   of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is   suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit   602946ec2f90 (\"powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly\") too.  On 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in commit 602946ec2f90 (\"powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly\"), but that commit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.  We can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current behaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().  For 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of virt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they are harmless.
