  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeontx2-af: Add validation before accessing cgx and lmac  with the addition of new MAC blocks like CN10K RPM and CN10KB RPM_USX, LMACs are noncontiguous and CGX blocks are also noncontiguous. But during RVU driver initialization, the driver is assuming they are contiguous and trying to access cgx or lmac with their id which is resulting in kernel panic.  This patch fixes the issue by adding proper checks.
