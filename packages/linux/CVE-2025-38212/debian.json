  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipc: fix to protect IPCS lookups using RCU  syzbot reported that it discovered a use-after-free vulnerability, [0]  [0]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/67af13f8.050a0220.21dd3.0038.GAE@google.com/  idr_for_each() is protected by rwsem, but this is not enough.  If it is not protected by RCU read-critical region, when idr_for_each() calls radix_tree_node_free() through call_rcu() to free the radix_tree_node structure, the node will be freed immediately, and when reading the next node in radix_tree_for_each_slot(), the already freed memory may be read.  Therefore, we need to add code to make sure that idr_for_each() is protected within the RCU read-critical region when we call it in shm_destroy_orphaned().",
