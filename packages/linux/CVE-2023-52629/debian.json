  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug  The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync() in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result, a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:        (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1) switch_drv_remove()              |  flush_work()                    |   ...                            |  switch_timer // timer                                  |   schedule_work(&psw->work)  timer_shutdown_sync()           |  ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker  kfree(psw) // free              |                                  |   psw->state = 0 // use  This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be stopped safely before the deallocate operations.",
