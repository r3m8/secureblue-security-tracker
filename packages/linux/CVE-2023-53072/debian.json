  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: use the workqueue to destroy unaccepted sockets  Christoph reported a UaF at token lookup time after having refactored the passive socket initialization part:    BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __token_bucket_busy+0x253/0x260   Read of size 4 at addr ffff88810698d5b0 by task syz-executor653/3198    CPU: 1 PID: 3198 Comm: syz-executor653 Not tainted 6.2.0-rc59af4eaa31c1f6c00c8f1e448ed99a45c66340dd5 #6   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014   Call Trace:    <TASK>    dump_stack_lvl+0x6e/0x91    print_report+0x16a/0x46f    kasan_report+0xad/0x130    __token_bucket_busy+0x253/0x260    mptcp_token_new_connect+0x13d/0x490    mptcp_connect+0x4ed/0x860    __inet_stream_connect+0x80e/0xd90    tcp_sendmsg_fastopen+0x3ce/0x710    mptcp_sendmsg+0xff1/0x1a20    inet_sendmsg+0x11d/0x140    __sys_sendto+0x405/0x490    __x64_sys_sendto+0xdc/0x1b0    do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x72/0xdc  We need to properly clean-up all the paired MPTCP-level resources and be sure to release the msk last, even when the unaccepted subflow is destroyed by the TCP internals via inet_child_forget().  We can re-use the existing MPTCP_WORK_CLOSE_SUBFLOW infra, explicitly checking that for the critical scenario: the closed subflow is the MPC one, the msk is not accepted and eventually going through full cleanup.  With such change, __mptcp_destroy_sock() is always called on msk sockets, even on accepted ones. We don't need anymore to transiently drop one sk reference at msk clone time.
