  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Fix kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrupt  Fix the following kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrrupt  [   14.339134]  btmtksdio_interrupt+0x28/0x54 [   14.339139]  process_sdio_pending_irqs+0x68/0x1a0 [   14.339144]  sdio_irq_work+0x40/0x70 [   14.339154]  process_one_work+0x184/0x39c [   14.339160]  worker_thread+0x228/0x3e8 [   14.339168]  kthread+0x148/0x3ac [   14.339176]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x30  That happened because hdev->power_on is already called before sdio_set_drvdata which btmtksdio_interrupt handler relies on is not properly set up.  The details are shown as the below: hci_register_dev would run queue_work(hdev->req_workqueue, &hdev->power_on) as WQ_HIGHPRI workqueue_struct to complete the power-on sequeunce and thus hci_power_on may run before sdio_set_drvdata is done in btmtksdio_probe.  The hci_dev_do_open in hci_power_on would initialize the device and enable the interrupt and thus it is possible that btmtksdio_interrupt is being called right before sdio_set_drvdata is filled out.  When btmtksdio_interrupt is being called and sdio_set_drvdata is not filled , the kernel oops is going to happen because btmtksdio_interrupt access an uninitialized pointer.",
