  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: don't leak snap_rwsem in handle_cap_grant  When handle_cap_grant is called on an IMPORT op, then the snap_rwsem is held and the function is expected to release it before returning. It currently fails to do that in all cases which could lead to a deadlock.",
