  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fuse: write inode in fuse_release()  A race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after fuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from fuse_release(), then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any remaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.  This is a partial revert of the blamed commit.",
