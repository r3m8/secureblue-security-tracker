  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: handle NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefully  syzbot reported a WARNING in iomap_iter_done:  iomap_fiemap+0x73b/0x9b0 fs/iomap/fiemap.c:80  ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline]  Generally, NONHEAD lclusters won't have delta[1]==0, except for crafted images and filesystems created by pre-1.0 mkfs versions.  Previously, it would immediately bail out if delta[1]==0, which led to inadequate decompressed lengths (thus FIEMAP is impacted).  Treat it as delta[1]=1 to work around these legacy mkfs versions.  `lclusterbits > 14` is illegal for compact indexes, error out too.",
