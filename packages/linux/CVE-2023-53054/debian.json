  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc2: fix a devres leak in hw_enable upon suspend resume  Each time the platform goes to low power, PM suspend / resume routines call: __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable -> devm_add_action_or_reset(). This adds a new devres each time. This may also happen at runtime, as dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable() can be called from udc_start().  This can be seen with tracing: - echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/dev/devres_log/enable - go to low power - cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace  A new \"ADD\" entry is found upon each low power cycle: ... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 82a13bba devm_action_release (8 bytes) ... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 49889daf devm_action_release (8 bytes) ...  A second issue is addressed here: - regulator_bulk_enable() is called upon each PM cycle (suspend/resume). - regulator_bulk_disable() never gets called.  So the reference count for these regulators constantly increase, by one upon each low power cycle, due to missing regulator_bulk_disable() call in __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().  The original fix that introduced the devm_add_action_or_reset() call, fixed an issue during probe, that happens due to other errors in dwc2_driver_probe() -> dwc2_core_reset(). Then the probe fails without disabling regulators, when dr_mode == USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL.  Rather fix the error path: disable all the low level hardware in the error path, by using the \"hsotg->ll_hw_enabled\" flag. Checking dr_mode has been introduced to avoid a dual call to dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable(). \"ll_hw_enabled\" should achieve the same (and is used currently in the remove() routine).",
