  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/qaic: Fix bootlog initialization ordering  As soon as we queue MHI buffers to receive the bootlog from the device, we could be receiving data. Therefore all the resources needed to process that data need to be setup prior to queuing the buffers.  We currently initialize some of the resources after queuing the buffers which creates a race between the probe() and any data that comes back from the device. If the uninitialized resources are accessed, we could see page faults.  Fix the init ordering to close the race.",
