  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test  The igb driver currently causes a NULL pointer dereference when executing the ethtool loopback test. This occurs because there is no associated q_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically not added to the test rings.  Since commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in __xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it. Therefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter.",
