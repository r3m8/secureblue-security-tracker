  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow  Fix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry. Such race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount and frees its index and entry while another process running command flush flow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handles commands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the other process released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix it by adding the needed spin lock.  It fixes the following warning trace:  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 540311 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0 ... RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0 ...
