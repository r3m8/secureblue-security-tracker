  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_pipe_release when deadlock is detected  mdp5_get_global_state runs the risk of hitting a -EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently mdp5_pipe_release doesn't check for if an error is returned. Because of this, there is a possibility of mdp5_pipe_release hitting a NULL dereference error.  To avoid this, let's have mdp5_pipe_release check if mdp5_get_global_state returns an error and propogate that error.  Changes since v1: - Separated declaration and initialization of *new_state to avoid   compiler warning - Fixed some spelling mistakes in commit message  Changes since v2: - Return 0 in case where hwpipe is NULL as this is considered normal   behavior - Added 2nd patch in series to fix a similar NULL dereference issue in   mdp5_mixer_release  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485179/",
