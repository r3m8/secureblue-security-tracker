  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove  The pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along with spmi_controller. On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres , including the clocks, will be cleanup. This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks in the pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.  This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and building the kernel with KASAN.  Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the clocks before freeing spmi_controller.",
