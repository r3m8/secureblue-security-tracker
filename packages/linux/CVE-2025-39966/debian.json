  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd: Fix race during abort for file descriptors  fput() doesn't actually call file_operations release() synchronously, it puts the file on a work queue and it will be released eventually.  This is normally fine, except for iommufd the file and the iommufd_object are tied to gether. The file has the object as it's private_data and holds a users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as the file is.  When the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it will fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This causes a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to decrement the users refcount.  Fix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call __fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before kfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object implementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file pointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.  If the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users refcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.  It is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an issue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().  The UAF looks like this:      BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376     Write of size 4 at addr ffff888059c97804 by task syz.0.46/6164      CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6164 Comm: syz.0.46 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)     Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025     Call Trace:      <TASK>      __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]      dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120      print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:378 [inline]      print_report+0xcd/0x630 mm/kasan/report.c:482      kasan_report+0xe0/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:595      check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]      kasan_check_range+0x100/0x1b0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189      instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:96 [inline]      atomic_fetch_sub_release include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h:400 [inline]      __refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:455 [inline]      refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:476 [inline]      iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376      __fput+0x402/0xb70 fs/file_table.c:468      task_work_run+0x14d/0x240 kernel/task_work.c:227      resume_user_mode_work include/linux/resume_user_mode.h:50 [inline]      exit_to_user_mode_loop+0xeb/0x110 kernel/entry/common.c:43      exit_to_user_mode_prepare include/linux/irq-entry-common.h:225 [inline]      syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work include/linux/entry-common.h:175 [inline]      syscall_exit_to_user_mode include/linux/entry-common.h:210 [inline]      do_syscall_64+0x41c/0x4c0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:100      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f",
