  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock  The following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:  - j1939_socks_lock - active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock  A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list that j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency, where, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time, another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock.  NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.
