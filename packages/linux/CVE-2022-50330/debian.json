  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: cavium - prevent integer overflow loading firmware  The \"code_length\" value comes from the firmware file.  If your firmware is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible. Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and prints warnings if it not capped correctly.  The \"ntohl(ucode->code_length) * 2\" multiplication can have an integer overflow.",
