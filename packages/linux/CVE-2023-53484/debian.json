  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries  When calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify argument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the corresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A subsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again leading to possible use after free.  Fix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have non-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in free_irq_cpu_rmap().  The current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases where irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the notify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we don't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this flow, hence the required fix.",
