  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet: pci-epf: Do not complete commands twice if nvmet_req_init() fails  Have nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete failed commands.  Description of the problem: nvmet_req_init() calls __nvmet_req_complete() internally upon failure, e.g., unsupported opcode, which calls the \"queue_response\" callback, this results in nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() being called, which will call nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() if data_len is 0 or if dma_dir is different from DMA_TO_DEVICE. This results in a double completion as nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() also calls nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() when nvmet_req_init() fails.  Steps to reproduce: On the host send a command with an unsupported opcode with nvme-cli, For example the admin command \"security receive\" $ sudo nvme security-recv /dev/nvme0n1 -n1 -x4096  This triggers a double completion as nvmet_req_init() fails and nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() is called, here iod->dma_dir is still in the default state of \"DMA_NONE\" as set by default in nvmet_pci_epf_alloc_iod(), so nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is called. Because nvmet_req_init() failed nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is also called in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() leading to a double completion. This not only sends two completions to the host but also corrupts the state of the PCI NVMe target leading to kernel oops.  This patch lets nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete all failed commands, and removes the double completion case in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() therefore fixing the edge cases where double completions occurred.",
