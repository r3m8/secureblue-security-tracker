  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound  Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure() for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver has been called.  Following is how the race occurs:  T1:Smmu device probe\t\tT2: Client device probe  really_probe() arm_smmu_device_probe() iommu_device_register() \t\t\t\t\treally_probe() \t\t\t\t\tplatform_dma_configure() \t\t\t\t\tof_dma_configure() \t\t\t\t\tof_dma_configure_id() \t\t\t\t\tof_iommu_configure() \t\t\t\t\tiommu_probe_device() \t\t\t\t\tiommu_init_device() \t\t\t\t\tarm_smmu_probe_device() \t\t\t\t\tarm_smmu_get_by_fwnode() \t\t\t\t\t\tdriver_find_device_by_fwnode() \t\t\t\t\t\tdriver_find_device() \t\t\t\t\t\tnext_device() \t\t\t\t\t\tklist_next() \t\t\t\t\t\t    /* null ptr \t\t\t\t\t\t       assigned to smmu */ \t\t\t\t\t/* null ptr dereference \t\t\t\t\t   while smmu->streamid_mask */ driver_bound() \tklist_add_tail()  When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.  Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.  [will: Add comment]",
