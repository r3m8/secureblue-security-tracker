  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion  The user_pversion was uninitialized for the user space file structure in the open function, because the file private structure use kmalloc for the allocation.  The kernel ALSA sequencer code clears the file structure, so no additional fixes are required.  BugLink: https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/issues/178",
