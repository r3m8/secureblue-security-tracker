  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread  This prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread requests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:    * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only     complete read requests.   * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the     request has not been read by the daemon.   * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.",
