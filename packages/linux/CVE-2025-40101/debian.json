  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data profile without an RST  At the end of btrfs_load_block_group_zone_info() the first thing we do is to ensure that if the mapping type is not a SINGLE one and there is no RAID stripe tree, then we return early with an error.  Doing that, though, prevents the code from running the last calls from this function which are about freeing memory allocated during its run. Hence, in this case, instead of returning early, we set the ret value and fall through the rest of the cleanup code.",
