  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/mlx5: Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error  This patch addresses a race condition for an ODP MR that can result in a CQE with an error on the UMR QP.  During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls occurs:  mlx5_revoke_mr()  mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()  mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()  At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.  However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.  This task will:  - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.  - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.  - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,    causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].  To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke, we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any further invalidation attempts on its lkey.
