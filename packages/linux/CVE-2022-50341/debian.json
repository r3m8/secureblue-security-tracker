To simply fix it, we could just pass @sign kmalloc'd from crypt_message() and then we're done.  Luckily, we don't seem to pass any other vmalloc'd buffers in smb_rqst::rq_iov...  Instead, let's map the correct pages and offsets from vmalloc buffers as well in cifs_sg_set_buf() and then avoiding such oopses.",
