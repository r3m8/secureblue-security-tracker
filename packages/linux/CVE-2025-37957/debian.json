  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Forcibly leave SMM mode on SHUTDOWN interception  Previously, commit ed129ec9057f (\"KVM: x86: forcibly leave nested mode on vCPU reset\") addressed an issue where a triple fault occurring in nested mode could lead to use-after-free scenarios. However, the commit did not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).  This omission results in triggering a WARN when KVM forces a vCPU INIT after SHUTDOWN interception while the vCPU is in SMM. This situation was reprodused using Syzkaller by:    1) Creating a KVM VM and vCPU   2) Sending a KVM_SMI ioctl to explicitly enter SMM   3) Executing invalid instructions causing consecutive exceptions and      eventually a triple fault  The issue manifests as follows:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 25506 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112   kvm_vcpu_reset+0x1d2/0x1530 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112   Modules linked in:   CPU: 0 PID: 25506 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted   6.1.130-syzkaller-00157-g164fe5dde9b6 #0   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),   BIOS 1.12.0-1 04/01/2014   RIP: 0010:kvm_vcpu_reset+0x1d2/0x1530 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112   Call Trace:    <TASK>    shutdown_interception+0x66/0xb0 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:2136    svm_invoke_exit_handler+0x110/0x530 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:3395    svm_handle_exit+0x424/0x920 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:3457    vcpu_enter_guest arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10959 [inline]    vcpu_run+0x2c43/0x5a90 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11062    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x50f/0x1cf0 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11283    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x570/0xf00 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4122    vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]    __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline]    __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline]    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x19a/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:856    do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline]    do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80 arch/x86/entry/common.c:81    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8  Architecturally, INIT is blocked when the CPU is in SMM, hence KVM's WARN() in kvm_vcpu_reset() to guard against KVM bugs, e.g. to detect improper emulation of INIT.  SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to do _something_ sane with the VMCB, since it's technically undefined, and INIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.  So, double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN, and force the vCPU out of SMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.
