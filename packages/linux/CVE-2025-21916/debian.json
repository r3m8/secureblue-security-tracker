  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: atm: cxacru: fix a flaw in existing endpoint checks  Syzbot once again identified a flaw in usb endpoint checking, see [1]. This time the issue stems from a commit authored by me (2eabb655a968 (\"usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()\")).  While using usb_find_common_endpoints() may usually be enough to discard devices with wrong endpoints, in this case one needs more than just finding and identifying the sufficient number of endpoints of correct types - one needs to check the endpoint's address as well.  Since cxacru_bind() fills URBs with CXACRU_EP_CMD address in mind, switch the endpoint verification approach to usb_check_XXX_endpoints() instead to fix incomplete ep testing.
