  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early  Move the creation of debugfs files into a dedicated function, and ensure they are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before associated data structures are freed.  Previously, debugfs files such as \"force_suspend\", \"force_wakeup\", and others were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed in vhci_release(). Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_data structure, any access to these files after release would result in use-after-free errors.  Although hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(), user can access files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs is released.",
