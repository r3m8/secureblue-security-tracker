  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: base: Free devm resources when unregistering a device  In the current code, devres_release_all() only gets called if the device has a bus and has been probed.  This leads to issues when using bus-less or driver-less devices where the device might never get freed if a managed resource holds a reference to the device. This is happening in the DRM framework for example.  We should thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function to make sure that the device-managed actions are properly executed when the device is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus nor a driver.  This is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da (\"devres: release resources on device_del()\") that got reverted by commit a525a3ddeaca (\"driver core: free devres in device_release\") over memory leaks concerns.  This patch effectively combines the two commits mentioned above to release the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and get the best of both worlds.",
