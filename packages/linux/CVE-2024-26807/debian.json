  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Both cadence-quadspi ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() implementations start with:  \tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev); \tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);  This obviously cannot be correct, unless \"struct cqspi_st\" is the first member of \" struct spi_controller\", or the other way around, but it is not the case. \"struct spi_controller\" is allocated by devm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory for private data, used to store \"struct cqspi_st\".  The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the device drvdata to store the address of the \"struct cqspi_st\" structure. Therefore:  \tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);  is correct, but:  \tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);  is not, as it makes \"host\" point not to a \"struct spi_controller\" but to the same \"struct cqspi_st\" structure as above.  This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes) directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM runtime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in turns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.  This has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the exact behavior will depend on the memory contents.  [0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/  This issue potentially affects all platforms that are currently using the cadence-quadspi driver.",
