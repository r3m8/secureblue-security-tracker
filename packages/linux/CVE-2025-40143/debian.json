  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: dont report verifier bug for missing bpf_scc_visit on speculative path  Syzbot generated a program that triggers a verifier_bug() call in maybe_exit_scc(). maybe_exit_scc() assumes that, when called for a state with insn_idx in some SCC, there should be an instance of struct bpf_scc_visit allocated for that SCC. Turns out the assumption does not hold for speculative execution paths. See example in the next patch.  maybe_scc_exit() is called from update_branch_counts() for states that reach branch count of zero, meaning that path exploration for a particular path is finished. Path exploration can finish in one of three ways: a. Verification error is found. In this case, update_branch_counts()    is called only for non-speculative paths. b. Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of    an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return    false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early. c. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by    is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates    bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.  Hence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption still holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC, bpf_scc_visit instance must exist.  This patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths.",
