  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1  Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:  Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but     handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000     req == 0000000060f99b40 not ok 11 req_destroy works  This is because \"sock_release(sock)\" was replaced with \"fput(filp)\" to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.  The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel() followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the final close is complete before it checks the pointer.  We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.  Reported by: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>",
