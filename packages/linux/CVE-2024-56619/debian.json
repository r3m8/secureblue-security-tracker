  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if KASAN is enabled.  This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry() and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which the i_size value is assigned.  This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access that exceeds the folio/page size.  Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit loss from \"unsigned int\" to \"u64\".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte() is also of type \"unsigned int\", but it is truncated so as not to exceed PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.",
