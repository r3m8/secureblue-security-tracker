  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops  In commit 42d9f6c77479 (\"crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation code into acomp\"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on having the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order as the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and free_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout randomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure (containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg are randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then the order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the union from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg will share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring they will always have the same layout.",
