  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm integrity: fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size  It is possible to set up dm-integrity in such a way that the \"tag_size\" parameter is less than the actual digest size. In this situation, a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.  In this case, dm-integrity would write beyond the end of the ic->recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in integrity_recalc->integrity_sector_checksum->crypto_shash_final.  Fix this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough padding at the end to accomodate the loop in integrity_recalc() being able to write a full digest size for the last member of the tags array.",
