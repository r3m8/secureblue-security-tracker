  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers/virt/acrn: fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map()  Patch series \"mm: follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes\".  Patch #1 fixes a bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver.  It compiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing from acrn folks.  Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding more sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick test on x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().   This patch (of 3):  We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous follow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.  (1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.  Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check for ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.  (2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.  As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is dangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.  (3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.  We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area. Let's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is actually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have worked either way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.",
