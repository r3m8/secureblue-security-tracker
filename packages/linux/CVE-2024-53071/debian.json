  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flags  The current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:  1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,    panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear    VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping    writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.    I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:    When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and    when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the    driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing    writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*    flushes happen.  2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are    mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).    MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has    copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but    fairly cursed.    In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs    during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()    wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into    the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault    handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so    if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when    it hits a BUG() check.  Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID doesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for the FLUSH_ID don't make sense).  Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing list; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.  Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't have a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it before applying it.",
