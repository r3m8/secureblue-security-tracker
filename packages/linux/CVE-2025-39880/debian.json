  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info  There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).  On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter, so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of 0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive fetching of new tickets.  con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily it's not something that happens often.",
