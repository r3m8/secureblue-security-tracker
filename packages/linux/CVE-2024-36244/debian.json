  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too  It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of entry intervals.  We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so we move the existing \"cycle == 0\" check outside the \"if \"(!new->cycle_time)\" branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.  Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.",
