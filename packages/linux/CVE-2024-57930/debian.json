  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Have process_string() also allow arrays  In order to catch a common bug where a TRACE_EVENT() TP_fast_assign() assigns an address of an allocated string to the ring buffer and then references it in TP_printk(), which can be executed hours later when the string is free, the function test_event_printk() runs on all events as they are registered to make sure there's no unwanted dereferencing.  It calls process_string() to handle cases in TP_printk() format that has \"%s\". It returns whether or not the string is safe. But it can have some false positives.  For instance, xe_bo_move() has:   TP_printk(\"move_lacks_source:%s, migrate object %p [size %zu] from %s to %s device_id:%s\",             __entry->move_lacks_source ? \"yes\" : \"no\", __entry->bo, __entry->size,             xe_mem_type_to_name[__entry->old_placement],             xe_mem_type_to_name[__entry->new_placement], __get_str(device_id))  Where the \"%s\" references into xe_mem_type_to_name[]. This is an array of pointers that should be safe for the event to access. Instead of flagging this as a bad reference, if a reference points to an array, where the record field is the index, consider it safe.",
