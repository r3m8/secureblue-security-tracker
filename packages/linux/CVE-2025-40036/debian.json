  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: fix possible map leak in fastrpc_put_args  copy_to_user() failure would cause an early return without cleaning up the fdlist, which has been updated by the DSP. This could lead to map leak. Fix this by redirecting to a cleanup path on failure, ensuring that all mapped buffers are properly released before returning.",
