  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()  In fs/ceph/caps.c, in encode_cap_msg(), \"use after free\" error was caught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This implies before the refcount could be increment here, it was freed.  In same file, in \"handle_cap_grant()\" refcount is decremented by this line - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race occurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former line could increment it.  encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where the refcount must be increased to prevent \"use after free\" error.",
