  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement  Ensure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput(). Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the superblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping the watched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before the watched_objects decrement. This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs, but the UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanks to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().  Also, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been freed, which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.",
