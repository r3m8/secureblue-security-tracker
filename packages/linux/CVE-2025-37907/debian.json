  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Fix locking order in ivpu_job_submit  Fix deadlock in job submission and abort handling. When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault, it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1).  After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread, the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list.

To resolve this issue, change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit().",
