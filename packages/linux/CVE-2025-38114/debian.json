  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock  Previously, e1000_down called cancel_work_sync for the e1000 reset task (via e1000_down_and_stop), which takes RTNL.  As reported by users and syzbot, a deadlock is possible in the following scenario:  CPU 0:   - RTNL is held   - e1000_close   - e1000_down   - cancel_work_sync (cancel / wait for e1000_reset_task())  CPU 1:   - process_one_work   - e1000_reset_task   - take RTNL  To remedy this, avoid calling cancel_work_sync from e1000_down (e1000_reset_task does nothing if the device is down anyway). Instead, call cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being removed.",
