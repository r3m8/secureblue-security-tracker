  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: reject unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign  The semantics for bpf_sk_assign are as follows:      sk = some_lookup_func()     bpf_sk_assign(skb, sk)     bpf_sk_release(sk)  That is, the sk is not consumed by bpf_sk_assign. The function therefore needs to make sure that sk lives long enough to be consumed from __inet_lookup_skb. The path through the stack for a TCPv4 packet is roughly:    netif_receive_skb_core: takes RCU read lock     __netif_receive_skb_core:       sch_handle_ingress:         tcf_classify:           bpf_sk_assign()       deliver_ptype_list_skb:         deliver_skb:           ip_packet_type->func == ip_rcv:             ip_rcv_core:             ip_rcv_finish_core:               dst_input:                 ip_local_deliver:                   ip_local_deliver_finish:                     ip_protocol_deliver_rcu:                       tcp_v4_rcv:                         __inet_lookup_skb:                           skb_steal_sock  The existing helper takes advantage of the fact that everything happens in the same RCU critical section: for sockets with SOCK_RCU_FREE set bpf_sk_assign never takes a reference. skb_steal_sock then checks SOCK_RCU_FREE again and does sock_put if necessary.  This approach assumes that SOCK_RCU_FREE is never set on a sk between bpf_sk_assign and skb_steal_sock, but this invariant is violated by unhashed UDP sockets. A new UDP socket is created in TCP_CLOSE state but without SOCK_RCU_FREE set. That flag is only added in udp_lib_get_port() which happens when a socket is bound.  When bpf_sk_assign was added it wasn't possible to access unhashed UDP sockets from BPF, so this wasn't a problem. This changed in commit 0c48eefae712 (\"sock_map: Lift socket state restriction for datagram sockets\"), but the helper wasn't adjusted accordingly. The following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount leak:  1. Add socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) to a sockmap. 2. Pull socket out of sockmap and bpf_sk_assign it. Since    SOCK_RCU_FREE is not set we increment the refcount. 3. bind() or connect() the socket, setting SOCK_RCU_FREE. 4. skb_steal_sock will now set refcounted = false due to    SOCK_RCU_FREE. 5. tcp_v4_rcv() skips sock_put().  Fix the problem by rejecting unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign(). This matches the behaviour of __inet_lookup_skb which is ultimately the goal of bpf_sk_assign().",
