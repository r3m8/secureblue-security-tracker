  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access  Per the SDM, \"any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed.\" Worse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 (\"kvm: LAPIC: write down valid APIC registers\"), such an access was explicitly disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.",
