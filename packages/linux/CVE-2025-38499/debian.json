  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns  What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  \"Wouldn't be able to undo\" may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.  clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.  There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually, but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.",
