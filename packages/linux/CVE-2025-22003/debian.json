  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source  Commit 7fdaf8966aae (\"can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()\") unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant to be a more secure alternative :)).  Let's consider below buffers:    dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */   src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */  When doing:    strncpy(dest, src, len);   dest[len] = '\\0';  strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.  On the other hand:    strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);  will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.  This exact pattern happened in ucan.  The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable can be removed.  On top of this do a couple refactors:    - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so     rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to     char.    - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware     string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it     directly handle all the string termination logic.",
