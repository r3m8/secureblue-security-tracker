  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request  Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():   general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122   CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65  RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0  Call Trace:  <TASK>  ? tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0  tb_cfg_request_work+0x33/0x80  worker_thread+0x386/0x8f0  kthread+0xed/0x110  ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30  The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request: first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second time from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del() from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints at it: 0xdead000000000122).  Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE bit set.",
