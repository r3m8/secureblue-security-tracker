  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference  The LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being removed from an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks currently like res->bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas bo->resource is protected by the object lock, while *clearing* of bo->resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means that if we check that bo->resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU lock we should be safe. So perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids dereferencing a NULL bo->resource in ttm_bo_swapout().",
