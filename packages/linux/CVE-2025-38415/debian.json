  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize  Syzkaller reports an \"UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read\" bug.  Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs filesystem, issues an ioctl(\"/dev/loop0\", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000).  Now if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super() fails.  ---- msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE); msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize); ----  sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.  As a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2 is set to 64.  This subsequently causes the  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/squashfs/block.c:195:36 shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')  This commit adds a check for a 0 return by sb_min_blocksize().",
