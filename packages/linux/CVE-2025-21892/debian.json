  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP  This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP, ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].  During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.  Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB specification.  This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.  To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.  Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.  Note: For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR. Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't care about its status.  [1] INFO: task rdma_resource_l:1922 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
