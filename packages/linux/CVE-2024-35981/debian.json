  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio_net: Do not send RSS key if it is not supported  There is a bug when setting the RSS options in virtio_net that can break the whole machine, getting the kernel into an infinite loop.  Running the following command in any QEMU virtual machine with virtionet will reproduce this problem:      # ethtool -X eth0  hfunc toeplitz  This is how the problem happens:  1) ethtool_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_set_rxfh()  2) virtnet_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_commit_rss_command()  3) virtnet_commit_rss_command() populates 4 entries for the rss scatter-gather  4) Since the command above does not have a key, then the last scatter-gatter entry will be zeroed, since rss_key_size == 0. sg_buf_size = vi->rss_key_size;  5) This buffer is passed to qemu, but qemu is not happy with a buffer with zero length, and do the following in virtqueue_map_desc() (QEMU function):    if (!sz) {       virtio_error(vdev, \"virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed\");  6) virtio_error() (also QEMU function) set the device as broken      vdev->broken = true;  7) Qemu bails out, and do not repond this crazy kernel.  8) The kernel is waiting for the response to come back (function virtnet_send_command())  9) The kernel is waiting doing the following :        while (!virtqueue_get_buf(vi->cvq, &tmp) && \t     !virtqueue_is_broken(vi->cvq)) \t      cpu_relax();  10) None of the following functions above is true, thus, the kernel loops here forever. Keeping in mind that virtqueue_is_broken() does not look at the qemu `vdev->broken`, so, it never realizes that the vitio is broken at QEMU side.  Fix it by not sending RSS commands if the feature is not available in the device.",
