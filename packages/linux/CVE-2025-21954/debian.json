  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netmem: prevent TX of unreadable skbs  Currently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not TX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet into the device's TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on dma addrs that should not be passed to it.  Fix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs.  Tested by configuring tc redirect:  sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress sudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \\ \ttcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1  Before, I see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma mapping APIs.  After, I don't see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma mapping APIs.",
