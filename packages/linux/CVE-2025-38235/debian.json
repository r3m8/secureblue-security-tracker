  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: appletb-kbd: fix \"appletb_backlight\" backlight device reference counting  During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a device in the backlight class which has name \"appletb_backlight\" and upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released leading to a reference leak.  Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal via put_device and on probe failure.",
