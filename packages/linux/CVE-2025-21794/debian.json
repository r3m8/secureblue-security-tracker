  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: hid-thrustmaster: fix stack-out-of-bounds read in usb_check_int_endpoints()  Syzbot[1] has detected a stack-out-of-bounds read of the ep_addr array from hid-thrustmaster driver. This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints function from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates over the elements of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of the array, it tries to read the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel.  To fix this, a 0 element was added at the end of the array to break the for loop.  [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad",
