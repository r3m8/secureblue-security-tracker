  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: compress: fix UAF of f2fs_inode_info in f2fs_free_dic  The decompress_io_ctx may be released asynchronously after I/O completion. If this file is deleted immediately after read, and the kworker of processing post_read_wq has not been executed yet due to high workloads, It is possible that the inode(f2fs_inode_info) is evicted and freed before it is used f2fs_free_dic.      The UAF case as below:     Thread A                                      Thread B     - f2fs_decompress_end_io      - f2fs_put_dic       - queue_work         add free_dic work to post_read_wq                                                    - do_unlink                                                     - iput                                                      - evict                                                       - call_rcu     This file is deleted after read.      Thread C                                 kworker to process post_read_wq     - rcu_do_batch      - f2fs_free_inode       - kmem_cache_free      inode is freed by rcu                                              - process_scheduled_works                                               - f2fs_late_free_dic                                                - f2fs_free_dic                                                 - f2fs_release_decomp_mem                                       read (dic->inode)->i_compress_algorithm  This patch store compress_algorithm and sbi in dic to avoid inode UAF.  In addition, the previous solution is deprecated in [1] may cause system hang. [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/c36ab955-c8db-4a8b-a9d0-f07b5f426c3f@kernel.org",
