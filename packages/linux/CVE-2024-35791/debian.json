  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()  Do the cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() before dropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or its array of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has __unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.  Note, the \"obvious\" alternative of using local variables doesn't fully resolve the bug, as region->pages is also dynamically allocated.  I.e. the region structure itself would be fine, but region->pages could be freed.  Flushing multiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entire flow is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that lack coherency for encrypted memory.",
