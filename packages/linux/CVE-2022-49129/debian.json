  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.  If the nic fails to start, it is possible that the reset_work has already been scheduled.  Ensure the work item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free crash in case cleanup is called before the work item is executed.  This fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio fails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not crash.",
