  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix handling of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepath  Commit fb70bf124b05 (\"NFSD: Instantiate a struct file when creating a regular NFSv4 file\") added the ability to cache an open fd over a compound. There are a couple of problems with the way this currently works:  It's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit cleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed out. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a valid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.  Also, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file if one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a valid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with the value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.  Fix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that takes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called, we'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If the nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the optional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.  Also rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an \"opened\" variant and don't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already have a cached open file.",
