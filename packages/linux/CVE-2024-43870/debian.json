  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Fix event leak upon exit  When a task is scheduled out, pending sigtrap deliveries are deferred to the target task upon resume to userspace via task_work.  However failures while adding an event's callback to the task_work engine are ignored. And since the last call for events exit happen after task work is eventually closed, there is a small window during which pending sigtrap can be queued though ignored, leaking the event refcount addition such as in the following scenario:      TASK A     -----      do_exit()        exit_task_work(tsk);         <IRQ>        perf_event_overflow()           event->pending_sigtrap = pending_id;           irq_work_queue(&event->pending_irq);        </IRQ>     =========> PREEMPTION: TASK A -> TASK B        event_sched_out()           event->pending_sigtrap = 0;           atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&event->refcount)           // FAILS: task work has exited           task_work_add(&event->pending_task)        [...]        <IRQ WORK>        perf_pending_irq()           // early return: event->oncpu = -1        </IRQ WORK>        [...]     =========> TASK B -> TASK A        perf_event_exit_task(tsk)           perf_event_exit_event()              free_event()                 WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&event->refcount, 1, 0) != 1)                 // leak event due to unexpected refcount == 2  As a result the event is never released while the task exits.  Fix this with appropriate task_work_add()'s error handling.",
