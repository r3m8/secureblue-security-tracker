  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply: core: Fix boundary conditions in interpolation  The functions power_supply_temp2resist_simple and power_supply_ocv2cap_simple handle boundary conditions incorrectly. The change was introduced in a4585ba2050f460f749bbaf2b67bd56c41e30283 (\"power: supply: core: Use library interpolation\"). There are two issues: First, the lines \"high = i - 1\" and \"high = i\" in ocv2cap have the wrong order compared to temp2resist. As a consequence, ocv2cap sets high=-1 if ocv>table[0].ocv, which causes an out-of-bounds read. Second, the logic of temp2resist is also not correct. Consider the case table[] = {{20, 100}, {10, 80}, {0, 60}}. For temp=5, we expect a resistance of 70% by interpolation. However, temp2resist sets high=low=2 and returns 60.",
