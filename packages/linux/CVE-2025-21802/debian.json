  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hns3: fix oops when unload drivers paralleling  When unload hclge driver, it tries to disable sriov first for each ae_dev node from hnae3_ae_dev_list. If user unloads hns3 driver at the time, because it removes all the ae_dev nodes, and it may cause oops.  But we can't simply use hnae3_common_lock for this. Because in the process flow of pci_disable_sriov(), it will trigger the remove flow of VF, which will also take hnae3_common_lock.  To fixes it, introduce a new mutex to protect the unload process.",
