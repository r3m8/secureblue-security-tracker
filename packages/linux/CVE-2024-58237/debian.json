  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers  Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call invalidates packet pointers.  Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for global sub-programs, such that the following program could be rejected:      int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)     {     \tbpf_tail_call_static(sk, &jmp_table, 0);     \treturn 0;     }      SEC(\"tc\")     int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)     {     \tint *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;     \t... make p valid ...     \ttail_call(sk);     \t*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */     \t...     }  The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that can invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.",
