  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: microchip: fix potential UAF in auxdev release callback  Similar to commit 1c11289b34ab (\"peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in adev_release()\"), the auxiliary device is not torn down in the correct order. If auxiliary_device_add() fails, the release callback will be called twice, resulting in a UAF. Due to timing, the auxdev code in this driver \"took inspiration\" from the aforementioned commit, and thus its bugs too!  Moving auxiliary_device_uninit() to the unregister callback instead avoids the issue.",
