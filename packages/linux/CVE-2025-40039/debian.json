  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access  The 'sess->rpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd session. Access to this list is intended to be protected by 'sess->rpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was flawed, leading to potential race conditions.  In ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock before calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify the XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access and prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.  Furthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load() without holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent data or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and the pointer is dereferenced.  Fix these issues by: 1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()    to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring    the lock is correctly released on error paths. 2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()    to safely protect the lookup.",
