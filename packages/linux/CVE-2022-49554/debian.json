  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration  The asynchronous zspage free worker tries to lock a zspage's entire page list without defending against page migration.  Since pages which haven't yet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while lock_zspage() churns away, lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different lethal races.  It can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely dereference page_private(), it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to the next page (since there's a data race), and it can observe a spurious NULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage's pages (since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list, and create_page_chain() unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the process).  Fix the races by using migrate_read_lock() in lock_zspage() to synchronize with page migration.",
