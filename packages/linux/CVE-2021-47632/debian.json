  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/set_memory: Avoid spinlock recursion in change_page_attr()  Commit 1f9ad21c3b38 (\"powerpc/mm: Implement set_memory() routines\") included a spin_lock() to change_page_attr() in order to safely perform the three step operations. But then commit 9f7853d7609d (\"powerpc/mm: Fix set_memory_*() against concurrent accesses\") modify it to use pte_update() and do the operation safely against concurrent access.  In the meantime, Maxime reported some spinlock recursion.

To do the operation atomically, we can't use pte modification helpers anymore. Because all platforms have different combination of bits, it is not easy to use those bits directly. But all have the _PAGE_KERNEL_{RO/ROX/RW/RWX} set of flags. All we need it to compare two sets to know which bits are set or cleared.  For instance, by comparing _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX and _PAGE_KERNEL_RO you know which bit gets cleared and which bit get set when changing exec permission.",
