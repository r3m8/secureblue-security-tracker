  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm raid: fix address sanitizer warning in raid_status  There is this warning when using a kernel with the address sanitizer and running this testsuite: https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-tests/-/tree/main/storage/swraid/scsi_raid  ================================================================== BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid] Read of size 4 at addr ffff888079d2c7e8 by task lvcreate/13319 CPU: 0 PID: 13319 Comm: lvcreate Not tainted 5.18.0-0.rc3.<snip> #1 Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 0.5.1 01/01/2011 Call Trace:  <TASK>  dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x9c  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x1e0  print_report.cold+0x55/0x244  kasan_report+0xc9/0x100  raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid]  dm_ima_measure_on_table_load+0x4b8/0xca0 [dm_mod]  table_load+0x35c/0x630 [dm_mod]  ctl_ioctl+0x411/0x630 [dm_mod]  dm_ctl_ioctl+0xa/0x10 [dm_mod]  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x12a/0x1a0  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x80  The warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The code in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and reads the entry max_nr_stripes.  However, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private doesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory and KASAN warns about it.  Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6.",
