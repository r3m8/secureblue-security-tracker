  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling  Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and their skb_shared_info.  The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.  A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.",
