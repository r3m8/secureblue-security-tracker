  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue  During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work item mwq->work_q. However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the already-freed mvs_info.  A typical race condition is illustrated below:  CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback) mvs_pci_remove()          |   mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()     cancel_delayed_work() |       kfree(mvi)          |                           |   mvi-> // UAF  Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.  This bug was found by static analysis.",
