  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()  Not everything requires locking in there, which is why the 'has_lock' variable exists. But enough does that it's a bit unwieldy to manage. Wrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return with no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will already have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.  This fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being actively resized at the same time.",
