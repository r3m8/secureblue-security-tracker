  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus  Without setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current driver may create at most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f. DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy device will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will directly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. Then NULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or internal phy is necessary, add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoud the issue.",
