  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD  Commit 672365477ae8 (\"x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required\") and commit 8bf26758ca96 (\"x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate\") introduced a per CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in order to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.  On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not reset, which brings them out of sync.  As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel space, which crashes the kernel.  To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.",
