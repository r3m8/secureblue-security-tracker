  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix skb leak in __skb_tstamp_tx()  Commit 50749f2dd685 (\"tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with TX timestamp.\") added a call to skb_orphan_frags_rx() to fix leaks with zerocopy skbs. But it ended up adding a leak of its own. When skb_orphan_frags_rx() fails, the function just returns, leaking the skb it just cloned. Free it before returning.  This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
