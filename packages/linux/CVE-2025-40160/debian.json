  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs  Change find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a different CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON() from bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate the error upwards.  Some VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must be bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for per-domain and global will probably fail when migrated off CPU 0, especially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now returns -EEXIST instead of BUG_ON().  A second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is not expected, but make it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don't know which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in.",
