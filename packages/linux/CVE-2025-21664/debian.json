  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function  The documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu() and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -> list_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these functions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a modification.  In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP fault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list head in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and turned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the list was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this occurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and a UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock, prior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it was possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's synchronize_rcu.  The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just the wrong moment which lead to this crash.  Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin() function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single READ_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.  This was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning suites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",
