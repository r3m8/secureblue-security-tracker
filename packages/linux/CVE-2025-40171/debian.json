  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet-fc: move lsop put work to nvmet_fc_ls_req_op  It\u2019s possible for more than one async command to be in flight from __nvmet_fc_send_ls_req. For each command, a tgtport reference is taken.  In the current code, only one put work item is queued at a time, which results in a leaked reference.  To fix this, move the work item to the nvmet_fc_ls_req_op struct, which already tracks all resources related to the command.",
