  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them  MTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching control of the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant has a separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.  So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it went unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit before accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.  Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this results in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is handled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().  Add the missing capability check to prevent this.",
