  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"Revert \"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"\"  A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit 2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"). The latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 (\"Revert \"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\"\"). Yet, the reverted commit was not the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf (\"block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change\").  So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b (\"block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges\") out. This commit restores it.  [1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214503",
