  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue  Currently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in pci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in pci_error_handlers.reset_done().  However, in the PCI framework: pci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -  pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler->reset_prepare(dev);  In pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked(): \tlist_for_each_entry(dev, &slot->bus->devices, bus_list) { \t\tif (!dev->slot || dev->slot!= slot) \t\t\tcontinue; \t\tpci_dev_save_and_disable(dev); \t\tif (dev->subordinate) \t\t\tpci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev->subordinate); \t}  This will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute err_handler->reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver to sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.  Since the driver now executes netif_device_detach() before the reset process, it will not concurrently with other netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.  Therefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and adjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure that multiple resets are not executed concurrently.",
