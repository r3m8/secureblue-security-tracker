  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: cacheinfo: Fix incorrect assignment of signed error value to unsigned fw_level  Though acpi_find_last_cache_level() always returned signed value and the document states it will return any errors caused by lack of a PPTT table, it never returned negative values before.  Commit 0c80f9e165f8 (\"ACPI: PPTT: Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage\") however changed it by returning -ENOENT if no PPTT was found. The value returned from acpi_find_last_cache_level() is then assigned to unsigned fw_level.  It will result in the number of cache leaves calculated incorrectly as a huge value which will then cause the following warning from __alloc_pages as the order would be great than MAX_ORDER because of incorrect and huge cache leaves value.    |  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at mm/page_alloc.c:5407 __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314   |  Modules linked in:   |  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.19.0-10393-g7c2a8d3ac4c0 #73   |  pstate: 20000005 (nzCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)   |  pc : __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314   |  lr : alloc_pages+0xe8/0x318   |  Call trace:   |   __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314   |   alloc_pages+0xe8/0x318   |   kmalloc_order_trace+0x68/0x1dc   |   __kmalloc+0x240/0x338   |   detect_cache_attributes+0xe0/0x56c   |   update_siblings_masks+0x38/0x284   |   store_cpu_topology+0x78/0x84   |   smp_prepare_cpus+0x48/0x134   |   kernel_init_freeable+0xc4/0x14c   |   kernel_init+0x2c/0x1b4   |   ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  Fix the same by changing fw_level to be signed integer and return the error from init_cache_level() early in case of error.",
