  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation  In rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O thread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gap between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv() from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O thread.  As a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's no I/O thread yet.  A better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.",
