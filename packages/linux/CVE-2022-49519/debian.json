  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ath10k: skip ath10k_halt during suspend for driver state RESTARTING  Double free crash is observed when FW recovery(caused by wmi timeout/crash) is followed by immediate suspend event. The FW recovery is triggered by ath10k_core_restart() which calls driver clean up via ath10k_halt(). When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery, the restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes. The suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt() The double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be called twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker thread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.  To fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in ath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING. Also, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call ath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop(). This is because call to ath10k_wait_for_suspend() is skipped later in [ath10k_halt() > ath10k_core_stop()] for the driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.  The frozen restart worker thread will be cancelled during resume when the device comes out of suspend.
