When the flush is needed the code jumps out-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue the syscall return.  However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correct location, instead branching back just prior to the return to userspace, causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.  The breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc (\"powerpc/syscall: implement system call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32\") which inadvertently removed the \"1\" label and reused it elsewhere.  Fix it by adding named local labels in the correct locations. Note that the return label needs to be outside the ifdef so that CONFIG_PPC_47x=n compiles.",
