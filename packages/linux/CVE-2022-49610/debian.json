  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: VMX: Prevent RSB underflow before vmenter  On VMX, there are some balanced returns between the time the guest's SPEC_CTRL value is written, and the vmenter.  Balanced returns (matched by a preceding call) are usually ok, but it's at least theoretically possible an NMI with a deep call stack could empty the RSB before one of the returns.  For maximum paranoia, don't allow *any* returns (balanced or otherwise) between the SPEC_CTRL write and the vmenter.    [ bp: Fix 32-bit build. ]",
