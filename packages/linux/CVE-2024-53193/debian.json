  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider  Some heap space is allocated for the flexible structure `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws` through the composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function `loongson2_clk_probe()`, as shown below:  289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp; \t... 296         for (p = data; p->name; p++) 297                 clks_num++; 298 299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num), 300                            GFP_KERNEL);  Then some data is written into the flexible array:  350                 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id] = hw;  This corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediately following the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider`:  struct loongson2_clk_provider { \tvoid __iomem *base; \tstruct device *dev; \tstruct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data; \tspinlock_t clk_lock;\t/* protect access to DIV registers */ };  The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in the middle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider` instead of at the end.  Fix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` to the end of `struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to help prevent this from happening again in case new members are added to the structure in the future.  This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-end warning:  drivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c:32:36: warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]",
