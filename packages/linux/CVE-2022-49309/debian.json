  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: staging: rtl8723bs: Fix deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback()  There is a deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback(), which is shown below:     (Thread 1)                  |      (Thread 2)                                | _set_timer() rtw_surveydone_event_callback()|  mod_timer()  spin_lock_bh() //(1)          |  (wait a time)  ...                           | rtw_scan_timeout_handler()  del_timer_sync()              |  spin_lock_bh() //(2)  (wait timer to stop)          |  ...  We hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need pmlmepriv->lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, rtw_surveydone_event_callback() will block forever.  This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_bh(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() in rtw_scan_timeout_handler() to spin_lock_irq(). Otherwise, spin_lock_bh() will also cause deadlock() in timer handler.",
