  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mld: avoid panic on init failure  In case of an error during init, in_hw_restart will be set, but it will never get cleared. Instead, we will retry to init again, and then we will act like we are in a restart when we are actually not.  This causes (among others) to a NULL pointer dereference when canceling rx_omi::finished_work, that was not even initialized, because we thought that we are in hw_restart.  Set in_hw_restart to true only if the fw is running, then we know that FW was loaded successfully and we are not going to the retry loop.",
