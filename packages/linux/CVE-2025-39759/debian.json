  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl  There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from the fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.  This happens as follows:  1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();  2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls    btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that    point fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by    task A);  3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups    from fs_info->qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;  4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating    the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,    but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding    the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.  Fix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config(). Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas were already disabled.",
