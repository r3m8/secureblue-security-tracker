  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels  Some lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation dst. If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording a reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel state will never be freed.  Discovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed to catch per-cpu memory leaks. I'm not sure if rpl and seg6 can actually hit this, but in principle I don't see why not.",
