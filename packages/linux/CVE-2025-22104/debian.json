  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Use kernel helpers for hex dumps  Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer was cast to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer size was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.  Therefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.  This patch address KASAN reports like the one below:   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Login Buffer:   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 01000000af000000   <...>   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 2e6d62692e736261   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 65050003006d6f63   ==================================================================   BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ibmvnic_login+0xacc/0xffc [ibmvnic]   Read of size 8 at addr c0000001331a9aa8 by task ip/17681   <...>   Allocated by task 17681:   <...>   ibmvnic_login+0x2f0/0xffc [ibmvnic]   ibmvnic_open+0x148/0x308 [ibmvnic]   __dev_open+0x1ac/0x304   <...>   The buggy address is located 168 bytes inside of                 allocated 175-byte region [c0000001331a9a00, c0000001331a9aaf)   <...>   =================================================================   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 000000000033766e",
