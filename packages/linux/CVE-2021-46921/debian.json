  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()  While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed successfully which isn\u2019t ordered. This exposes the window between the acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before the write lock is truly acquired.  We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from under it.

Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire semantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can be switched to use relaxed semantics.  [peterz: use try_cmpxchg()]",
