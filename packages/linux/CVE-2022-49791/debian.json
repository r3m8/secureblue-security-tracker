  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix multishot accept request leaks  Having REQ_F_POLLED set doesn't guarantee that the request is executed as a multishot from the polling path. Fortunately for us, if the code thinks it's multishot issue when it's not, it can only ask to skip completion so leaking the request. Use issue_flags to mark multipoll issues.",
