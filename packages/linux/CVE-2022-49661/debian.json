  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_open/close(): fix memory leak  The gs_usb driver appears to suffer from a malady common to many USB CAN adapter drivers in that it performs usb_alloc_coherent() to allocate a number of USB request blocks (URBs) for RX, and then later relies on usb_kill_anchored_urbs() to free them, but this doesn't actually free them. As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that's been used by the driver.  This commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2 driver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It explicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to usb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the gs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the disconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.  For more information, see the 928150fad41b (\"can: esd_usb2: fix memory leak\").",
