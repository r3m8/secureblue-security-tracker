  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints  As part of commit e81a7018d93a (\"usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure dynamically\") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free the dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when usb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().  However, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer situation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints() have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head anchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed, the first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and likewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list. The dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a use-after-free when it calls list_del().  This was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind. The recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown callback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.  There are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform a list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from the rest of the dwc3_ep chain.  Another approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the usb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\" components.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be called before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget().",
