  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler  Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.  This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:   - N hardware queues   - queue depth is M for each hardware queue   - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests  If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M - 1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.  If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).  Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't need the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never covers that.
