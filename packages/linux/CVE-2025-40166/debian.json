  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/guc: Check GuC running state before deregistering exec queue  In normal operation, a registered exec queue is disabled and deregistered through the GuC, and freed only after the GuC confirms completion. However, if the driver is forced to unbind while the exec queue is still running, the user may call exec_destroy() after the GuC has already been stopped and CT communication disabled.  In this case, the driver cannot receive a response from the GuC, preventing proper cleanup of exec queue resources. Fix this by directly releasing the resources when GuC is not running.  Here is the failure dmesg log: \" [  468.089581] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]--- [  468.089608] pci 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: GUC ID manager unclean (1/65535) [  468.090558] pci 0000:03:00.0: [drm] GT0:     total 65535 [  468.090562] pci 0000:03:00.0: [drm] GT0:     used 1 [  468.090564] pci 0000:03:00.0: [drm] GT0:     range 1..1 (1) [  468.092716] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [  468.092719] WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 4775 at drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_ttm_vram_mgr.c:298 ttm_vram_mgr_fini+0xf8/0x130 [xe] \"  v2: use xe_uc_fw_is_running() instead of xe_guc_ct_enabled().
