  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: mt7530: fix VLAN traffic leaks  PCR_MATRIX field was set to all 1's when VLAN filtering is enabled, but was not reset when it is disabled, which may cause traffic leaks:  \tip link add br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1 \tip link add br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 1 \tip link set swp0 master br0 \tip link set swp1 master br1 \tip link set br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 0 \tip link set br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 0 \t# traffic in br0 and br1 will start leaking to each other  As port_bridge_{add,del} have set up PCR_MATRIX properly, remove the PCR_MATRIX write from mt7530_port_set_vlan_aware.",
