  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released  A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability was identified in the PSI (Pressure Stall Information) monitoring mechanism:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 Read of size 8 at addr ffff3de3d50bd308 by task systemd/1  psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140 cgroup_pressure_poll+0x70/0xa0 cgroup_file_poll+0x8c/0x100 kernfs_fop_poll+0x11c/0x1c0 ep_item_poll.isra.0+0x188/0x2c0  Allocated by task 1: cgroup_file_open+0x88/0x388 kernfs_fop_open+0x73c/0xaf0 do_dentry_open+0x5fc/0x1200 vfs_open+0xa0/0x3f0 do_open+0x7e8/0xd08 path_openat+0x2fc/0x6b0 do_filp_open+0x174/0x368  Freed by task 8462: cgroup_file_release+0x130/0x1f8 kernfs_drain_open_files+0x17c/0x440 kernfs_drain+0x2dc/0x360 kernfs_show+0x1b8/0x288 cgroup_file_show+0x150/0x268 cgroup_pressure_write+0x1dc/0x340 cgroup_file_write+0x274/0x548  Reproduction Steps: 1. Open test/cpu.pressure and establish epoll monitoring 2. Disable monitoring: echo 0 > test/cgroup.pressure 3. Re-enable monitoring: echo 1 > test/cgroup.pressure  The race condition occurs because: 1. When cgroup.pressure is disabled (echo 0 > cgroup.pressure), it:    - Releases PSI triggers via cgroup_file_release()    - Frees of->priv through kernfs_drain_open_files() 2. While epoll still holds reference to the file and continues polling 3. Re-enabling (echo 1 > cgroup.pressure) accesses freed of->priv  epolling\t\t\tdisable/enable cgroup.pressure fd=open(cpu.pressure) while(1) ... epoll_wait kernfs_fop_poll kernfs_get_active = true\techo 0 > cgroup.pressure ...\t\t\t\tcgroup_file_show \t\t\t\tkernfs_show \t\t\t\t// inactive kn \t\t\t\tkernfs_drain_open_files \t\t\t\tcft->release(of); \t\t\t\tkfree(ctx); \t\t\t\t... kernfs_get_active = false \t\t\t\techo 1 > cgroup.pressure \t\t\t\tkernfs_show \t\t\t\tkernfs_activate_one(kn); kernfs_fop_poll kernfs_get_active = true cgroup_file_poll psi_trigger_poll // UAF ... end: close(fd)  To address this issue, introduce kernfs_get_active_of() for kernfs open files to obtain active references. This function will fail if the open file has been released. Replace kernfs_get_active() with kernfs_get_active_of() to prevent further operations on released file descriptors.",
