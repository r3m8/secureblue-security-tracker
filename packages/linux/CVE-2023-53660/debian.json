  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, cpumap: Handle skb as well when clean up ptr_ring  The following warning was reported when running xdp_redirect_cpu with both skb-mode and stress-mode enabled:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   Incorrect XDP memory type (-2128176192) usage   WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1442 at net/core/xdp.c:405   Modules linked in:   CPU: 7 PID: 1442 Comm: kworker/7:0 Tainted: G  6.5.0-rc2+ #1   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)   Workqueue: events __cpu_map_entry_free   RIP: 0010:__xdp_return+0x1e4/0x4a0   ......

One is due to the kthread cpu_map_kthread_run() is stopped prematurely. Another one is __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() doesn't handle skb mode and treats skbs in ptr_ring as XDP frames.  Prematurely-stopped kthread will be fixed by the preceding patch and ptr_ring will be empty when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() is called. But as the comments in __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() said, handling and freeing skbs in ptr_ring as well to \"catch any broken behaviour gracefully\".",
