  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too  Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part 3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), so the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that protection, there is an unprotected \"uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);\" call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the reason why we do not see lots of these reports.  Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.  Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this dereference to the if too.  I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130. Thanks.",
