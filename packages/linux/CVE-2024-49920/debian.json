  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before multiple uses  [WHAT & HOW] Poniters, such as stream_enc and dc->bw_vbios, are null checked previously in the same function, so Coverity warns \"implies that stream_enc and dc->bw_vbios might be null\". They are used multiple times in the subsequent code and need to be checked.  This fixes 10 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.",
