  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroying  Presently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal marked with JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp running stress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is possible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is destroyed eg:  (umount) ext4_kill_sb   kill_block_super     generic_shutdown_super       sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */       evict_inodes         /* might start a new txn */       ext4_put_super \tflush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */         jbd2_journal_destroy           journal_kill_thread             journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;           jbd2_journal_commit_transaction             jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer               jbd2_journal_bmap                 ext4_journal_bmap                   ext4_map_blocks                     ...                     ext4_inode_error                       ext4_handle_error                         schedule_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)                                                 /* work queue kicks in */                                                update_super_work                                                  jbd2_journal_start                                                    start_this_handle                                                      BUG_ON(journal->j_flags &                                                             JBD2_UNMOUNT)  Hence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do a journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just fallback to an un-journaled commit.  Further, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:    1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying   2. force a commit and wait for it   3. flush pending sb updates  This sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb update that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the journal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)  Also, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only called from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",
