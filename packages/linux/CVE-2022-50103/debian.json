  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched, cpuset: Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed  With cgroup v2, the cpuset's cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating that the cpuset will just use the effective CPUs of its parent. So cpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask. This can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call to dl_bw_of() to crash due to percpu value access of an out of bound CPU value. For example:  \t[80468.182258] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff8b6648b0 \t  : \t[80468.191019] RIP: 0010:dl_cpu_busy+0x30/0x2b0 \t  : \t[80468.207946] Call Trace: \t[80468.208947]  cpuset_can_attach+0xa0/0x140 \t[80468.209953]  cgroup_migrate_execute+0x8c/0x490 \t[80468.210931]  cgroup_update_dfl_csses+0x254/0x270 \t[80468.211898]  cgroup_subtree_control_write+0x322/0x400 \t[80468.212854]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0 \t[80468.213777]  new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0 \t[80468.214689]  vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280 \t[80468.215592]  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0 \t[80468.216463]  do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80 \t[80468.224287]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae  Fix that by using effective_cpus instead. For cgroup v1, effective_cpus is the same as cpus_allowed. For v2, effective_cpus is the real cpumask to be used by tasks within the cpuset anyway.  Also update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to reflect the change. In addition, a check is added to task_can_attach() to guard against the possibility that cpumask_any_and() may return a value >= nr_cpu_ids.",
