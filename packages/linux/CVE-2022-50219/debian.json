  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix KASAN use-after-free Read in compute_effective_progs  Syzbot found a Use After Free bug in compute_effective_progs(). The reproducer creates a number of BPF links, and causes a fault injected alloc to fail, while calling bpf_link_detach on them. Link detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(), which calls __cgroup_bpf_detach() and update_effective_progs(). If the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores the pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory gets freed just after it returns. After this, every subsequent call to update_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be dereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers KASAN UAF error.  To fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the list, but remove it and replace it with a dummy prog without shrinking the table. The subsequent call to __cgroup_bpf_detach() or __cgroup_bpf_detach() will correct it.",
