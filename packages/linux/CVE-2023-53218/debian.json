  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted  When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the connection parameters.  However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is made.  Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an oops may follow shortly thereafter.",
