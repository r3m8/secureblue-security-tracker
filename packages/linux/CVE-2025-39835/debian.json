  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfs: do not propagate ENODATA disk errors into xattr code  ENODATA (aka ENOATTR) has a very specific meaning in the xfs xattr code; namely, that the requested attribute name could not be found.  However, a medium error from disk may also return ENODATA. At best, this medium error may escape to userspace as \"attribute not found\" when in fact it's an IO (disk) error.  At worst, we may oops in xfs_attr_leaf_get() when we do:  \terror = xfs_attr_leaf_hasname(args, &bp); \tif (error == -ENOATTR)  { \t\txfs_trans_brelse(args->trans, bp); \t\treturn error; \t}  because an ENODATA/ENOATTR error from disk leaves us with a null bp, and the xfs_trans_brelse will then null-deref it.  As discussed on the list, we really need to modify the lower level IO functions to trap all disk errors and ensure that we don't let unique errors like this leak up into higher xfs functions - many like this should be remapped to EIO.  However, this patch directly addresses a reported bug in the xattr code, and should be safe to backport to stable kernels. A larger-scope patch to handle more unique errors at lower levels can follow later.  (Note, prior to 07120f1abdff we did not oops, but we did return the wrong error code to userspace.)",
