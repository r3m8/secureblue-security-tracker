  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost: Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting  panfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned a BO but with the only reference being from the handle, which user space could in theory guess and release, causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then a(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.  The _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern, so ditch it and instead create the handle in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(). If the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() fails then this means that user space has indeed gone behind our back and freed the handle. In which case just return an error code.",
