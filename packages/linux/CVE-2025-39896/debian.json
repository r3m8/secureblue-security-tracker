  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery work from being queued during device removal  Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() in ivpu_dev_fini() to ensure that no new recovery work items can be queued after device removal has started. Previously, recovery work could be scheduled even after canceling existing work, potentially leading to use-after-free bugs if recovery accessed freed resources.  Rename ivpu_pm_cancel_recovery() to ivpu_pm_disable_recovery() to better reflect its new behavior.",
