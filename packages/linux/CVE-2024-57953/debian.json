  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()  \ttmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The \"tmp\" variable is an s64 but \"offset\" is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large, (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion mark.  Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.",
