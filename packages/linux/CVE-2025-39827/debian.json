  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount  Current implementation maintains two separate reference counting mechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from rose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracks references from rose_sock.  This patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' field for proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing and decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incremented or decremented.  This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and rose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects before freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().  These changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when all references, including those from rose_node structures, are released. As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.",
