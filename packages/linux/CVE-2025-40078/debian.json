  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Explicitly check accesses to bpf_sock_addr  Syzkaller found a kernel warning on the following sock_addr program:      0: r0 = 0     1: r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +60)     2: exit  which triggers:      verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion (0)  This is happening because offset 60 in bpf_sock_addr corresponds to an implicit padding of 4 bytes, right after msg_src_ip4. Access to this padding isn't rejected in sock_addr_is_valid_access and it thus later fails to convert the access.  This patch fixes it by explicitly checking the various fields of bpf_sock_addr in sock_addr_is_valid_access.  I checked the other ctx structures and is_valid_access functions and didn't find any other similar cases. Other cases of (properly handled) padding are covered in new tests in a subsequent patch.",
