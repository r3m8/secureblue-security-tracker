  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: af_alg - Fix incorrect boolean values in af_alg_ctx  Commit 1b34cbbf4f01 (\"crypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg\") changed some fields from bool to 1-bit bitfields of type u32.  However, some assignments to these fields, specifically 'more' and 'merge', assign values greater than 1.  These relied on C's implicit conversion to bool, such that zero becomes false and nonzero becomes true.  With a 1-bit bitfields of type u32 instead, mod 2 of the value is taken instead, resulting in 0 being assigned in some cases when 1 was intended.  Fix this by restoring the bool type.",
