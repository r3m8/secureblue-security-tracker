  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: staging: rtl8192e: Fix deadlock in rtllib_beacons_stop()  There is a deadlock in rtllib_beacons_stop(), which is shown below:     (Thread 1)              |      (Thread 2)                            | rtllib_send_beacon() rtllib_beacons_stop()      |  mod_timer()  spin_lock_irqsave() //(1) |  (wait a time)  ...                       | rtllib_send_beacon_cb()  del_timer_sync()          |  spin_lock_irqsave() //(2)  (wait timer to stop)      |  ...  We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, rtllib_beacons_stop() will block forever.  This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.",
