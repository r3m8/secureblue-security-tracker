  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: fix random stack corruption after get_block  When get_block is called with a buffer_head allocated on the stack, such as do_mpage_readpage, stack corruption due to buffer_head UAF may occur in the following race condition situation.       <CPU 0>                      <CPU 1> mpage_read_folio   <<bh on stack>>   do_mpage_readpage     exfat_get_block       bh_read         __bh_read \t  get_bh(bh)           submit_bh           wait_on_buffer                               ...                               end_buffer_read_sync                                 __end_buffer_read_notouch                                    unlock_buffer           <<keep going>>         ...       ...     ...   ... <<bh is not valid out of mpage_read_folio>>    .    . another_function   <<variable A on stack>>                                    put_bh(bh)                                      atomic_dec(bh->b_count)   * stack corruption here *  This patch returns -EAGAIN if a folio does not have buffers when bh_read needs to be called. By doing this, the caller can fallback to functions like block_read_full_folio(), create a buffer_head in the folio, and then call get_block again.  Let's do not call bh_read() with on-stack buffer_head.",
