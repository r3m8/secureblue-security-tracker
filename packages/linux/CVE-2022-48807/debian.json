  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler  Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.  Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.  Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev and related braces.",
