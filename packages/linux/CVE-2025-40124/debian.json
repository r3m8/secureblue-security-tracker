  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III  Anthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios enabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values greater than the size to be copied. This lead to __copy_from_iter() returning impossible values instead of the actual number of bytes it was able to copy.  The BUG_ON has been reported in https://lore.kernel.org/r/b14f55642207e63e907965e209f6323a0df6dcee.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de  The referenced commit introduced exception handlers on user-space memory references in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These handlers return from the respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy using the current register contents. The exception handlers expect that %o2 has already been masked during the bulk copy loop, but the masking was performed after that loop. This will fix the return value of copy_from_user and copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays unchanged.",
