  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: Avoid cross-chip syncing of VLAN filtering  Changes to VLAN filtering are not applicable to cross-chip notifications.  On a system like this:  .-----.   .-----.   .-----. | sw1 +---+ sw2 +---+ sw3 | '-1-2-'   '-1-2-'   '-1-2-'  Before this change, upon sw1p1 leaving a bridge, a call to dsa_port_vlan_filtering would also be made to sw2p1 and sw3p1.  In this scenario:  .---------.   .-----.   .-----. |   sw1   +---+ sw2 +---+ sw3 | '-1-2-3-4-'   '-1-2-'   '-1-2-'  When sw1p4 would leave a bridge, dsa_port_vlan_filtering would be called for sw2 and sw3 with a non-existing port - leading to array out-of-bounds accesses and crashes on mv88e6xxx.",
