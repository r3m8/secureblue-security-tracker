  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag  There is a crash when adding one of the lan966x interfaces under a lag interface. The issue can be reproduced like this: ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor ip link set dev eth0 master bond0  The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports it would just crash as they are NULL pointers. The fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing something from the ports. Like we do in other places.",
