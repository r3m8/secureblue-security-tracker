  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info  Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post() is done so that the context is still available after the wait loop has given up.  There was a case where a slow development firmware caused the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried to complete_all() the completion context that had been created on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed. This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing and gnashing of teeth.",
