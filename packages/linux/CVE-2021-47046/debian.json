  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()  The hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry for HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one read overflow.  I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offset from similar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c.  I also declared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX entries.  This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and suspenders approach to try future proof the code.",
