  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t  The 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh structure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.  For example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operation via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.  This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which operate reference counts atomically.",
