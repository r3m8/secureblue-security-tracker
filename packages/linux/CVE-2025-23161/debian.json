  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: vmd: Make vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type  The access to the PCI config space via pci_ops::read and pci_ops::write is a low-level hardware access. The functions can be accessed with disabled interrupts even on PREEMPT_RT. The pci_lock is a raw_spinlock_t for this purpose.  A spinlock_t becomes a sleeping lock on PREEMPT_RT, so it cannot be acquired with disabled interrupts. The vmd_dev::cfg_lock is accessed in the same context as the pci_lock.  Make vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type so it can be used with interrupts disabled.  This was reported as:    BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48   Call Trace:    rt_spin_lock+0x4e/0x130    vmd_pci_read+0x8d/0x100 [vmd]    pci_user_read_config_byte+0x6f/0xe0    pci_read_config+0xfe/0x290    sysfs_kf_bin_read+0x68/0x90  [bigeasy: reword commit message] Tested-off-by: Luis Claudio R.
