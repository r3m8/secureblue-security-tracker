  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rfkill: gpio: Fix crash due to dereferencering uninitialized pointer  Since commit 7d5e9737efda (\"net: rfkill: gpio: get the name and type from device property\") rfkill_find_type() gets called with the possibly uninitialized \"const char *type_name;\" local variable.  On x86 systems when rfkill-gpio binds to a \"BCM4752\" or \"LNV4752\" acpi_device, the rfkill->type is set based on the ACPI acpi_device_id:          rfkill->type = (unsigned)id->driver_data;  and there is no \"type\" property so device_property_read_string() will fail and leave type_name uninitialized, leading to a potential crash.  rfkill_find_type() does accept a NULL pointer, fix the potential crash by initializing type_name to NULL.  Note likely sofar this has not been caught because:  1. Not many x86 machines actually have a \"BCM4752\"/\"LNV4752\" acpi_device 2. The stack happened to contain NULL where type_name is stored",
