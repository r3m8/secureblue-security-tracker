  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix double put of request  If a netfs request finishes during the pause loop, it will have the ref that belongs to the IN_PROGRESS flag removed at that point - however, if it then goes to the final wait loop, that will *also* put the ref because it sees that the IN_PROGRESS flag is clear and incorrectly assumes that this happened when it called the collector.  In fact, since IN_PROGRESS is clear, we shouldn't call the collector again since it's done all the cleanup, such as calling ->ki_complete().  Fix this by making netfs_collect_in_app() just return, indicating that we're done if IN_PROGRESS is removed.",
