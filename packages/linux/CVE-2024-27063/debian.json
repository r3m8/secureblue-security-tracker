  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  leds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify  Commit d5e01266e7f5 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link speed mode\") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUP mode in commit cee4bd16c319 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck NETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUP on dev rename\") and moved it to a generic function.  This changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the dev from the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but in the new implementation with the generic function, the dev in trigger_data is used instead.  This is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact that the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as the new one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and saved in the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).  On calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this cause a kernel panic.  To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after the new net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTER case) and correctly parse the new dev.",
