  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal  If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply or MST up request sideband message, the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is possible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing the reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (\"drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length check\").  Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), however this would require a bigger change. Since the fix is also needed for stable, opting for the simpler solution in this patch.",
