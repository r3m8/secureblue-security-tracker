  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, sockmap: Fix double uncharge the mem of sk_msg  If tcp_bpf_sendmsg is running during a tear down operation, psock may be freed.  tcp_bpf_sendmsg()  tcp_bpf_send_verdict()   sk_msg_return()   tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()    unlikely(!psock))      sk_msg_free()  The mem of msg has been uncharged in tcp_bpf_send_verdict() by sk_msg_return(), and would be uncharged by sk_msg_free() again. When psock is null, we can simply returning an error code, this would then trigger the sk_msg_free_nocharge in the error path of __SK_REDIRECT and would have the side effect of throwing an error up to user space. This would be a slight change in behavior from user side but would look the same as an error if the redirect on the socket threw an error.  This issue can cause the following info: WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2136 at net/ipv4/af_inet.c:155 inet_sock_destruct+0x13c/0x260 Call Trace:  <TASK>  __sk_destruct+0x24/0x1f0  sk_psock_destroy+0x19b/0x1c0  process_one_work+0x1b3/0x3c0  worker_thread+0x30/0x350  ? process_one_work+0x3c0/0x3c0  kthread+0xe6/0x110  ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20  ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30  </TASK>",
