  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()  In remove_phb_dynamic() we use &phb->io_resource, after we've called device_unregister(&host_bridge->dev). But the unregister may have freed phb, because pcibios_free_controller_deferred() is the release function for the host_bridge.  If there are no outstanding references when we call device_unregister() then phb will be freed out from under us.  This has gone mainly unnoticed, but with slub_debug and page_poison enabled it can lead to a crash:    PID: 7574   TASK: c0000000d492cb80  CPU: 13  COMMAND: \"drmgr\"    #0 [c0000000e4f075a0] crash_kexec at c00000000027d7dc    #1 [c0000000e4f075d0] oops_end at c000000000029608    #2 [c0000000e4f07650] __bad_page_fault at c0000000000904b4    #3 [c0000000e4f076c0] do_bad_slb_fault at c00000000009a5a8    #4 [c0000000e4f076f0] data_access_slb_common_virt at c000000000008b30    Data SLB Access [380] exception frame:    R0:  c000000000167250    R1:  c0000000e4f07a00    R2:  c000000002a46100    R3:  c000000002b39ce8    R4:  00000000000000c0    R5:  00000000000000a9    R6:  3894674d000000c0    R7:  0000000000000000    R8:  00000000000000ff    R9:  0000000000000100    R10: 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b    R11: 0000000000008000    R12: c00000000023da80    R13: c0000009ffd38b00    R14: 0000000000000000    R15: 000000011c87f0f0    R16: 0000000000000006    R17: 0000000000000003    R18: 0000000000000002    R19: 0000000000000004    R20: 0000000000000005    R21: 000000011c87ede8    R22: 000000011c87c5a8    R23: 000000011c87d3a0    R24: 0000000000000000    R25: 0000000000000001    R26: c0000000e4f07cc8    R27: c00000004d1cc400    R28: c0080000031d00e8    R29: c00000004d23d800    R30: c00000004d1d2400    R31: c00000004d1d2540    NIP: c000000000167258    MSR: 8000000000009033    OR3: c000000000e9f474    CTR: 0000000000000000    LR:  c000000000167250    XER: 0000000020040003    CCR: 0000000024088420    MQ:  0000000000000000    DAR: 6b6b6b6b6b6b6ba3    DSISR: c0000000e4f07920     Syscall Result: fffffffffffffff2    [NIP  : release_resource+56]    [LR   : release_resource+48]    #5 [c0000000e4f07a00] release_resource at c000000000167258  (unreliable)    #6 [c0000000e4f07a30] remove_phb_dynamic at c000000000105648    #7 [c0000000e4f07ab0] dlpar_remove_slot at c0080000031a09e8 [rpadlpar_io]    #8 [c0000000e4f07b50] remove_slot_store at c0080000031a0b9c [rpadlpar_io]    #9 [c0000000e4f07be0] kobj_attr_store at c000000000817d8c   #10 [c0000000e4f07c00] sysfs_kf_write at c00000000063e504   #11 [c0000000e4f07c20] kernfs_fop_write_iter at c00000000063d868   #12 [c0000000e4f07c70] new_sync_write at c00000000054339c   #13 [c0000000e4f07d10] vfs_write at c000000000546624   #14 [c0000000e4f07d60] ksys_write at c0000000005469f4   #15 [c0000000e4f07db0] system_call_exception at c000000000030840   #16 [c0000000e4f07e10] system_call_vectored_common at c00000000000c168  To avoid it, we can take a reference to the host_bridge->dev until we're done using phb.
