  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: wilc1000: unregister wiphy only if it has been registered  There is a specific error path in probe functions in wilc drivers (both sdio and spi) which can lead to kernel panic, as this one for example when using SPI:  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 9f000000 when read [9f000000] *pgd=00000000 Internal error: Oops: 5 [#1] ARM Modules linked in: wilc1000_spi(+) crc_itu_t crc7 wilc1000 cfg80211 bluetooth ecdh_generic ecc CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 106 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.13.0-rc3+ #22 Hardware name: Atmel SAMA5 PC is at wiphy_unregister+0x244/0xc40 [cfg80211] LR is at wiphy_unregister+0x1c0/0xc40 [cfg80211] [...]  wiphy_unregister [cfg80211] from wilc_netdev_cleanup+0x380/0x494 [wilc1000]  wilc_netdev_cleanup [wilc1000] from wilc_bus_probe+0x360/0x834 [wilc1000_spi]  wilc_bus_probe [wilc1000_spi] from spi_probe+0x15c/0x1d4  spi_probe from really_probe+0x270/0xb2c  really_probe from __driver_probe_device+0x1dc/0x4e8  __driver_probe_device from driver_probe_device+0x5c/0x140  driver_probe_device from __driver_attach+0x220/0x540  __driver_attach from bus_for_each_dev+0x13c/0x1a8  bus_for_each_dev from bus_add_driver+0x2a0/0x6a4  bus_add_driver from driver_register+0x27c/0x51c  driver_register from do_one_initcall+0xf8/0x564  do_one_initcall from do_init_module+0x2e4/0x82c  do_init_module from load_module+0x59a0/0x70c4  load_module from init_module_from_file+0x100/0x148  init_module_from_file from sys_finit_module+0x2fc/0x924  sys_finit_module from ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x1c  The issue can easily be reproduced, for example by not wiring correctly a wilc device through SPI (and so, make it unresponsive to early SPI commands). It is due to a recent change decoupling wiphy allocation from wiphy registration, however wilc_netdev_cleanup has not been updated accordingly, letting it possibly call wiphy unregister on a wiphy which has never been registered.  Fix this crash by moving wiphy_unregister/wiphy_free out of wilc_netdev_cleanup, and by adjusting error paths in both drivers",
