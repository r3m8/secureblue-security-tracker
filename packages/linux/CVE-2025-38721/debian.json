  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump  There is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():       if (res < 0) {                 nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general); // HERE                 cb->args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;                 ...  While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last. If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented. This 2nd increment is never undone.  This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn keeps prevents cnet->count from dropping back to 0.  This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.  This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop. It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before I see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.  One fix would to change this to:         if (res < 0) { \t\tif (ct != last) \t                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general);  But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place. We can just store a cookie value instead.  A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table, it looks to me as if this has the same problem and like ctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual object so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well.",
