  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/port: Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration race  The CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem ->probe() time, establishes a lineage of ports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of a CXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the cxl_port driver.  Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage goes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a cxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.  The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through ->remove().  That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent. Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed:  1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free    scenarios like this signature:      BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kworker/u56:0/11     Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS edk2-20230524-3.fc38 05/24/2023     Workqueue: cxl_port detach_memdev [cxl_core]     RIP: 0010:spin_bug+0x65/0xa0     Call Trace:       do_raw_spin_lock+0x69/0xa0      __mutex_lock+0x695/0xb80      delete_endpoint+0xad/0x150 [cxl_core]      devres_release_all+0xb8/0x110      device_unbind_cleanup+0xe/0x70      device_release_driver_internal+0x1d2/0x210      detach_memdev+0x15/0x20 [cxl_core]      process_one_work+0x1e3/0x4c0      worker_thread+0x1dd/0x3d0  2/ In the case of RCH topologies, the parent device that needs to be    locked is not always @port->dev as returned by cxl_mem_find_port(), use    endpoint->dev.parent instead.",
