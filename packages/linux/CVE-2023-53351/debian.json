  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/sched: Check scheduler work queue before calling timeout handling  During an IGT GPU reset test we see again oops despite of commit 0c8c901aaaebc9 (drm/sched: Check scheduler ready before calling timeout handling).  It uses ready condition whether to call drm_sched_fault which unwind the TDR leads to GPU reset. However it looks the ready condition is overloaded with other meanings, for example, for the following stack is related GPU reset :  0  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start 1  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_resume 2  gfx_v9_0_cp_resume 3  gfx_v9_0_hw_init 4  gfx_v9_0_resume 5  amdgpu_device_ip_resume_phase2  does the following: \t/* start the ring */ \tgfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start(adev); \tring->sched.ready = true;  The same approach is for other ASICs as well : gfx_v8_0_cp_gfx_resume gfx_v10_0_kiq_resume, etc...  As a result, our GPU reset test causes GPU fault which calls unconditionally gfx_v9_0_fault and then drm_sched_fault. However now it depends on whether the interrupt service routine drm_sched_fault is executed after gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start is completed which sets the ready field of the scheduler to true even  for uninitialized schedulers and causes oops vs no fault or when ISR  drm_sched_fault is completed prior  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start and NULL pointer dereference does not occur.  Use the field timeout_wq  to prevent oops for uninitialized schedulers. The field could be initialized by the work queue of resetting the domain.  v1: Corrections to commit message (Luben)",
