  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: change vm->task_info handling  This patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm->task_info object. The major changes are: - vm->task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is   reference counted. - introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management     - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before       returning this info     - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info - last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.  This patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage of vm->task_info.  V2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)  V3: Fixed review comments from Felix    - Fix wrong indentation    - No debug message for -ENOMEM    - Add NULL check for task_info    - Do not duplicate the debug messages (ti vs no ti)    - Get first reference of task_info in vm_init(), put last      in vm_fini()  V4: Fixed review comments from Felix    - fix double reference increment in create_task_info    - change amdgpu_vm_get_task_info_pasid    - additional changes in amdgpu_gem.c while porting",
