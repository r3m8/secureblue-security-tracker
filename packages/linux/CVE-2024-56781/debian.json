  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing powermac #size-cells  On some powermacs `escc` nodes are missing `#size-cells` properties, which is deprecated and now triggers a warning at boot since commit 045b14ca5c36 (\"of: WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells handling\").  For example:    Missing '#size-cells' in /pci@f2000000/mac-io@c/escc@13000   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/of/base.c:133 of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108   Hardware name: PowerMac3,1 7400 0xc0209 PowerMac   ...   Call Trace:     of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108 (unreliable)     of_bus_default_count_cells+0x40/0x60     __of_get_address+0xc8/0x21c     __of_address_to_resource+0x5c/0x228     pmz_init_port+0x5c/0x2ec     pmz_probe.isra.0+0x144/0x1e4     pmz_console_init+0x10/0x48     console_init+0xcc/0x138     start_kernel+0x5c4/0x694  As powermacs boot via prom_init it's possible to add the missing properties to the device tree during boot, avoiding the warning. Note that `escc-legacy` nodes are also missing `#size-cells` properties, but they are skipped by the macio driver, so leave them alone.
