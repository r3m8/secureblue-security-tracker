  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  futex: Prevent use-after-free during requeue-PI  syzbot managed to trigger the following race:     T1                               T2   futex_wait_requeue_pi()    futex_do_wait()      schedule()                                futex_requeue()                                  futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()                                    futex_requeue_pi_prepare()                                    requeue_pi_wake_futex()                                      futex_requeue_pi_complete()                                       /* preempt */           * timeout/ signal wakes T1 *     futex_requeue_pi_wakeup_sync() // Q_REQUEUE_PI_LOCKED    futex_hash_put()   // back to userland, on stack futex_q is garbage                                        /* back */                                      wake_up_state(q->task, TASK_NORMAL);  In this scenario futex_wait_requeue_pi() is able to leave without using futex_q::lock_ptr for synchronization.  This can be prevented by reading futex_q::task before updating the futex_q::requeue_state. A reference on the task_struct is not needed because requeue_pi_wake_futex() is invoked with a spinlock_t held which implies a RCU read section.  Even if T1 terminates immediately after, the task_struct will remain valid during T2's wake_up_state().  A READ_ONCE on futex_q::task before futex_requeue_pi_complete() is enough because it ensures that the variable is read before the state is updated.  Read futex_q::task before updating the requeue state, use it for the following wakeup.",
