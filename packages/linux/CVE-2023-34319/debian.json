  "description": "The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal with a frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the headers would come in one piece.  Unfortunately the logic introduced there didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split into as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still being smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible) headers together.  Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.",
