  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5: Don't leak some plane state  Apparently no one noticed that mdp5 plane states leak like a sieve ever since we introduced plane_state->commit refcount a few years ago in 21a01abbe32a (\"drm/atomic: Fix freeing connector/plane state too early by tracking commits, v3.\")  Fix it by using the right helpers.
