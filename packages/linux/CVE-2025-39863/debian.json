  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix use-after-free when rescheduling brcmf_btcoex_info work  The brcmf_btcoex_detach() only shuts down the btcoex timer, if the flag timer_on is false. However, the brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc(), which runs as timer handler, sets timer_on to false. This creates critical race conditions:  1.If brcmf_btcoex_detach() is called while brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc() is executing, it may observe timer_on as false and skip the call to timer_shutdown_sync().  2.The brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc() may then reschedule the brcmf_btcoex_info worker after the cancel_work_sync() has been executed, resulting in use-after-free bugs.  The use-after-free bugs occur in two distinct scenarios, depending on the timing of when the brcmf_btcoex_info struct is freed relative to the execution of its worker thread.  Scenario 1: Freed before the worker is scheduled  The brcmf_btcoex_info is deallocated before the worker is scheduled. A race condition can occur when schedule_work(&bt_local->work) is called after the target memory has been freed. The sequence of events is detailed below:  CPU0                           | CPU1 brcmf_btcoex_detach            | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc                                |   bt_local->timer_on = false;   if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)   |     ...                        |   cancel_work_sync();          |   ...                          |   kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE  |                                |   schedule_work(&bt_local->work); // USE  Scenario 2: Freed after the worker is scheduled  The brcmf_btcoex_info is freed after the worker has been scheduled but before or during its execution. In this case, statements within the brcmf_btcoex_handler() \u2014 such as the container_of macro and subsequent dereferences of the brcmf_btcoex_info object will cause a use-after-free access. The following timeline illustrates this scenario:  CPU0                            | CPU1 brcmf_btcoex_detach             | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc                                 |   bt_local->timer_on = false;   if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)    |     ...                         |   cancel_work_sync();           |   ...                           |   schedule_work(); // Reschedule                                 |   kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE   |   brcmf_btcoex_handler() // Worker   /*                            |     btci = container_of(....); // USE    The kfree() above could      |     ...    also occur at any point      |     btci-> // USE    during the worker's execution|    */                           |  To resolve the race conditions, drop the conditional check and call timer_shutdown_sync() directly. It can deactivate the timer reliably, regardless of its current state. Once stopped, the timer_on state is then set to false.",
