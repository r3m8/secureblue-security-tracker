  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix skb size by accounting for skb_shared_info  While transitioning from netdev_alloc_ip_align() to build_skb(), memory for the \"skb_shared_info\" member of an \"skb\" was not allocated. Fix this by allocating \"PAGE_SIZE\" as the skb length, accounting for the packet length, headroom and tailroom, thereby including the required memory space for skb_shared_info.",
