  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: ralink: mt7621-pci: add sentinel to quirks table  With mt7621 soc_dev_attr fixed to register the soc as a device, kernel will experience an oops in soc_device_match_attr  This quirk test was introduced in the staging driver in commit 9445ccb3714c (\"staging: mt7621-pci-phy: add quirks for 'E2' revision using 'soc_device_attribute'\"). The staging driver was removed, and later re-added in commit d87da32372a0 (\"phy: ralink: Add PHY driver for MT7621 PCIe PHY\") for kernel 5.11",
