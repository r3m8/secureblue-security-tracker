  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio_net: fix xdp_rxq_info bug after suspend/resume  The following sequence currently causes a driver bug warning when using virtio_net:    # ip link set eth0 up   # echo mem > /sys/power/state (or e.g. # rtcwake -s 10 -m mem)   <resume>   # ip link set eth0 down    Missing register, driver bug   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 375 at net/core/xdp.c:138 xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60   Call trace:    xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60    virtnet_close+0x58/0xac    __dev_close_many+0xac/0x140    __dev_change_flags+0xd8/0x210    dev_change_flags+0x24/0x64    do_setlink+0x230/0xdd0    ...  This happens because virtnet_freeze() frees the receive_queue completely (including struct xdp_rxq_info) but does not call xdp_rxq_info_unreg(). Similarly, virtnet_restore() sets up the receive_queue again but does not call xdp_rxq_info_reg().  Actually, parts of virtnet_freeze_down() and virtnet_restore_up() are almost identical to virtnet_close() and virtnet_open(): only the calls to xdp_rxq_info_(un)reg() are missing. This means that we can fix this easily and avoid such problems in the future by just calling virtnet_close()/open() from the freeze/restore handlers.  Aside from adding the missing xdp_rxq_info calls the only difference is that the refill work is only cancelled if netif_running(). However, this should not make any functional difference since the refill work should only be active if the network interface is actually up.",
