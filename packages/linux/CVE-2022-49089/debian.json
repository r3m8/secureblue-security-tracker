  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  IB/rdmavt: add lock to call to rvt_error_qp to prevent a race condition  The documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and s_lock need to be held when calling that function.  It also asserts using lockdep that both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in Fixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no longer covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing and also possibly in a race condition.",
