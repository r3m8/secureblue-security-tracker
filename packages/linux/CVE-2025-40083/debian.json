  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue  To prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c) when cl->qdisc->ops->peek(cl->qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return value before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.  To avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:  1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static inline function.  2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to include/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.  3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.",
