  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: airspy: fix memory leak in airspy probe  The commit ca9dc8d06ab6 (\"media: airspy: respect the DMA coherency  rules\") moves variable buf from stack to heap, however, it only frees buf in the error handling code, missing deallocation in the success path.  Fix this by freeing buf in the success path since this variable does not have any references in other code.",
