  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks  There is a deadlock issue found in sungem driver, please refer to the commit ac0a230f719b (\"eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks\"). The root cause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic context and disable_irq() is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface of sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing the implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have the same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the .ndo_poll_controller is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver, so fec_poll_controller() can be safely removed.",
