  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: tas2781: Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv  During the conversion to unify the calibration data management, the reference to tasdevice_priv was wrongly set to h->hda_priv instead of h->priv.  This resulted in memory corruption and crashes eventually. Unfortunately it's a void pointer, hence the compiler couldn't know that it's wrong.",
