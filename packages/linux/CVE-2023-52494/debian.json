  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer  Though we do check the event ring read pointer by \"is_valid_ring_ptr\" to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the pointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements are 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer could lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.  So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.",
