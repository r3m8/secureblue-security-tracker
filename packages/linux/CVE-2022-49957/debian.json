  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kcm: fix strp_init() order and cleanup  strp_init() is called just a few lines above this csk->sk_user_data check, it also initializes strp->work etc., therefore, it is unnecessary to call strp_done() to cancel the freshly initialized work.  And if sk_user_data is already used by KCM, psock->strp should not be touched, particularly strp->work state, so we need to move strp_init() after the csk->sk_user_data check.  This also makes a lockdep warning reported by syzbot go away.",
