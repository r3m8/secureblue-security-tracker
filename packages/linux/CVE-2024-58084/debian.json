  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()  Commit 2e4955167ec5 (\"firmware: qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq completion variable initialization\") introduced a write barrier in probe function to store global '__scm' variable.  We all known barriers are paired (see memory-barriers.txt: \"Note that write barriers should normally be paired with read or address-dependency barriers\"), therefore accessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let's use that directly.  Lack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable value, NULL, and dereferencing it.  Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control dependency.",
