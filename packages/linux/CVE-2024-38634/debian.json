  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: max3100: Lock port->lock when calling uart_handle_cts_change()  uart_handle_cts_change() has to be called with port lock taken, Since we run it in a separate work, the lock may not be taken at the time of running. Make sure that it's taken by explicitly doing that. Without it we got a splat:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:3491 uart_handle_cts_change+0xa6/0xb0   ...   Workqueue: max3100-0 max3100_work [max3100]   RIP: 0010:uart_handle_cts_change+0xa6/0xb0   ...    max3100_handlerx+0xc5/0x110 [max3100]    max3100_work+0x12a/0x340 [max3100]",
