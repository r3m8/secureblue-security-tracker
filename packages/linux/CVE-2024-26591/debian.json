  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix re-attachment branch in bpf_tracing_prog_attach  The following case can cause a crash due to missing attach_btf:  1) load rawtp program 2) load fentry program with rawtp as target_fd 3) create tracing link for fentry program with target_fd = 0 4) repeat 3  In the end we have:  - prog->aux->dst_trampoline == NULL - tgt_prog == NULL (because we did not provide target_fd to link_create) - prog->aux->attach_btf == NULL (the program was loaded with attach_prog_fd=X) - the program was loaded for tgt_prog but we have no way to find out which one      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058     Call Trace:      <TASK>      ? __die+0x20/0x70      ? page_fault_oops+0x15b/0x430      ? fixup_exception+0x22/0x330      ? exc_page_fault+0x6f/0x170      ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30      ? bpf_tracing_prog_attach+0x279/0x560      ? btf_obj_id+0x5/0x10      bpf_tracing_prog_attach+0x439/0x560      __sys_bpf+0x1cf4/0x2de0      __x64_sys_bpf+0x1c/0x30      do_syscall_64+0x41/0xf0      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76  Return -EINVAL in this situation.",
