  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEAD  In ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if the kernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write() will always return -EIO, so the daemon can't pass the copen to the kernel. Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task.  Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing /dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to avoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached data before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.  Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req, otherwise it may UAF.",
