  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: fix dangling sco_conn and use-after-free in sco_sock_timeout  Connecting the same socket twice consecutively in sco_sock_connect() could lead to a race condition where two sco_conn objects are created but only one is associated with the socket. If the socket is closed before the SCO connection is established, the timer associated with the dangling sco_conn object won't be canceled. As the sock object is being freed, the use-after-free problem happens when the timer callback function sco_sock_timeout() accesses the socket. Here's the call trace:  dump_stack+0x107/0x163 ? refcount_inc+0x1c/ print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1c/0x47e ? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b kasan_report+0x13a/0x173 ? refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b check_memory_region+0x132/0x139 refcount_inc+0x1c/0x7b sco_sock_timeout+0xb2/0x1ba process_one_work+0x739/0xbd1 ? cancel_delayed_work+0x13f/0x13f ? __raw_spin_lock_init+0xf0/0xf0 ? to_kthread+0x59/0x85 worker_thread+0x593/0x70e kthread+0x346/0x35a ? drain_workqueue+0x31a/0x31a ? kthread_bind+0x4b/0x4b ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30",
