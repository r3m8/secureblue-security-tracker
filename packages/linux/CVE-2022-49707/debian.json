  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: add reserved GDT blocks check  We capture a NULL pointer issue when resizing a corrupt ext4 image which is freshly clear resize_inode feature (not run e2fsck). It could be simply reproduced by following steps. The problem is because of the resize_inode feature was cleared, and it will convert the filesystem to meta_bg mode in ext4_resize_fs(), but the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks was not reduced to zero, so could we mistakenly call reserve_backup_gdb() and passing an uninitialized resize_inode to it when adding new group descriptors.   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda 3G  tune2fs -O ^resize_inode /dev/sda #forget to run requested e2fsck  mount /dev/sda /mnt  resize2fs /dev/sda 8G   ========  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028  CPU: 19 PID: 3243 Comm: resize2fs Not tainted 5.18.0-rc7-00001-gfde086c5ebfd #748  ...
