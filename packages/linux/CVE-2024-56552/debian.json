  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/guc_submit: fix race around suspend_pending  Currently in some testcases we can trigger:  xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] Assertion `exec_queue_destroyed(q)` failed! .... WARNING: CPU: 18 PID: 2640 at drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_guc_submit.c:1826 xe_guc_sched_done_handler+0xa54/0xef0 [xe] xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT1: DEREGISTER_DONE: Unexpected engine state 0x00a1, guc_id=57  Looking at a snippet of corresponding ftrace for this GuC id we can see:  162.673311: xe_sched_msg_add:     dev=0000:03:00.0, gt=1 guc_id=57, opcode=3 162.673317: xe_sched_msg_recv:    dev=0000:03:00.0, gt=1 guc_id=57, opcode=3 162.673319: xe_exec_queue_scheduling_disable: dev=0000:03:00.0, 1:0x2, gt=1, width=1, guc_id=57, guc_state=0x29, flags=0x0 162.674089: xe_exec_queue_kill:   dev=0000:03:00.0, 1:0x2, gt=1, width=1, guc_id=57, guc_state=0x29, flags=0x0 162.674108: xe_exec_queue_close:  dev=0000:03:00.0, 1:0x2, gt=1, width=1, guc_id=57, guc_state=0xa9, flags=0x0 162.674488: xe_exec_queue_scheduling_done: dev=0000:03:00.0, 1:0x2, gt=1, width=1, guc_id=57, guc_state=0xa9, flags=0x0 162.678452: xe_exec_queue_deregister: dev=0000:03:00.0, 1:0x2, gt=1, width=1, guc_id=57, guc_state=0xa1, flags=0x0  It looks like we try to suspend the queue (opcode=3), setting suspend_pending and triggering a disable_scheduling. The user then closes the queue. However the close will also forcefully signal the suspend fence after killing the queue, later when the G2H response for disable_scheduling comes back we have now cleared suspend_pending when signalling the suspend fence, so the disable_scheduling now incorrectly tries to also deregister the queue. This leads to warnings since the queue has yet to even be marked for destruction. We also seem to trigger errors later with trying to double unregister the same queue.  To fix this tweak the ordering when handling the response to ensure we don't race with a disable_scheduling that didn't actually intend to perform an unregister.  The destruction path should now also correctly wait for any pending_disable before marking as destroyed.  (cherry picked from commit f161809b362f027b6d72bd998e47f8f0bad60a2e)",
