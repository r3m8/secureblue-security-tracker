  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path  When I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 (\"filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected\"), I missed that there are two copies of the code I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets on 32-bit kernels. Thanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable backport...  Apply exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.",
