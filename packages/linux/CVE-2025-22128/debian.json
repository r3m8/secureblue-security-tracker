  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path  If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in ath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless one of the functions requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.  This may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the affinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:  kernel/irq/manage.c:  \t/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */ \tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint)) \t\tdesc->affinity_hint = NULL;  So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does no harm.",
