  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  book3s64/radix : Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE  A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also. During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads to a kernel crash.  Kernel attempted to read user page (18) - exploit attempt?

If the section start address is not aligned to the PMD size, a VM_BUG_ON will be triggered when setting the PMD-sized page to page table.  In this patch, we are aligning the section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE. After alignment, the start address will not be part of the current namespace, and a normal page will be allocated for the vmemmap mapping of the current section. For the remaining sections, altmaps will be allocated. During the free operation, the normal page will be correctly freed.  In the same way, a PMD_SIZE vmemmap page will be allocated only if the section start address is PMD_SIZE-aligned; otherwise, it will fall back to a PAGE-sized vmemmap allocation.
