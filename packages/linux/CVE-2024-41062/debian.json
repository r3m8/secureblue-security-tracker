  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bluetooth/l2cap: sync sock recv cb and release  The problem occurs between the system call to close the sock and hci_rx_work, where the former releases the sock and the latter accesses it without lock protection.             CPU0                       CPU1            ----                       ----            sock_close                 hci_rx_work \t   l2cap_sock_release         hci_acldata_packet \t   l2cap_sock_kill            l2cap_recv_frame \t   sk_free                    l2cap_conless_channel \t                              l2cap_sock_recv_cb  If hci_rx_work processes the data that needs to be received before the sock is closed, then everything is normal; Otherwise, the work thread may access the released sock when receiving data.  Add a chan mutex in the rx callback of the sock to achieve synchronization between the sock release and recv cb.  Sock is dead, so set chan data to NULL, avoid others use invalid sock pointer.",
