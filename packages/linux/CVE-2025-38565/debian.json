  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail  When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase the perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another reference count leak.  Return early on failure to prevent that.",
