  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use  gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[] and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length *without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:  [   80.842193] memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0 [   80.842243] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 272 at lib/string_helpers.c:1032 __fortify_report+0x45/0x50 ... [   80.843175]  __fortify_panic+0x9/0xb [   80.843186]  vsc_tp_xfer.cold+0x67/0x67 [mei_vsc_hw] [   80.843210]  ? seqcount_lockdep_reader_access.constprop.0+0x82/0x90 [   80.843229]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7c/0x110 [   80.843250]  mei_vsc_hw_start+0x98/0x120 [mei_vsc] [   80.843270]  mei_reset+0x11d/0x420 [mei]  The easiest fix would be to just drop the counted-by but with the exception of the ack buffer in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only contains enough room for the packet-header, all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a buffer of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.  Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split the vsc_tp_packet struct definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer overrun checking still works when enabled.",
