  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of ns_writer on remount  If a nilfs2 filesystem is downgraded to read-only due to metadata corruption on disk and is remounted read/write, or if emergency read-only remount is performed, detaching a log writer and synchronizing the filesystem can be done at the same time.  In these cases, use-after-free of the log writer (hereinafter nilfs->ns_writer) can happen as shown in the scenario below:   Task1                               Task2  --------------------------------    ------------------------------  nilfs_construct_segment    nilfs_segctor_sync      init_wait      init_waitqueue_entry      add_wait_queue      schedule                                      nilfs_remount (R/W remount case) \t\t\t\t       nilfs_attach_log_writer                                          nilfs_detach_log_writer                                            nilfs_segctor_destroy                                              kfree      finish_wait        _raw_spin_lock_irqsave          __raw_spin_lock_irqsave            do_raw_spin_lock              debug_spin_lock_before  <-- use-after-free  While Task1 is sleeping, nilfs->ns_writer is freed by Task2.  After Task1 waked up, Task1 accesses nilfs->ns_writer which is already freed.  This scenario diagram is based on the Shigeru Yoshida's post [1].  This patch fixes the issue by not detaching nilfs->ns_writer on remount so that this UAF race doesn't happen.  Along with this change, this patch also inserts a few necessary read-only checks with superblock instance where only the ns_writer pointer was used to check if the filesystem is read-only.",
