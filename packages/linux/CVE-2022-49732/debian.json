  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sock: redo the psock vs ULP protection check  Commit 8a59f9d1e3d4 (\"sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()\") has moved the inet_csk_has_ulp(sk) check from sk_psock_init() to the new tcp_bpf_update_proto() function. I'm guessing that this was done to allow creating psocks for non-inet sockets.  Unfortunately the destruction path for psock includes the ULP unwind, so we need to fail the sk_psock_init() itself. Otherwise if ULP is already present we'll notice that later, and call tcp_update_ulp() with the sk_proto of the ULP itself, which will most likely result in the ULP looping its callbacks.",
