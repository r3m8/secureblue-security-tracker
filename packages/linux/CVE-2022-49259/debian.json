  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: don't delete queue kobject before its children  kobjects aren't supposed to be deleted before their child kobjects are deleted.  Apparently this is usually benign; however, a WARN will be triggered if one of the child kobjects has a named attribute group:      sysfs group 'modes' not found for kobject 'crypto'     WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/group.c:278 sysfs_remove_group+0x72/0x80     ...
