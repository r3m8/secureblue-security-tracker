  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/omap: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs  There are two issues here:  1) The \"len\" variable needs to be checked before the very first write.    Otherwise if omap2_iommu_dump_ctx() with \"bytes\" less than 32 it is a    buffer overflow. 2) The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes that *would* have    been copied if there were enough space.  But we want to know the    number of bytes which were *actually* copied so use scnprintf()    instead.",
