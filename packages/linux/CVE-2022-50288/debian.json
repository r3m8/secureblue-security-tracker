  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure  adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained pointer, which is potentially freed at that point.  Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.",
