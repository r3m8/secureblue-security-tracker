  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memcg: fix possible use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()  memcg_write_event_control() accesses the dentry->d_name of the specified control fd to route the write call.  As a cgroup interface file can't be renamed, it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a regular cgroup file.  Also, as these cgroup interface files can't be removed before the directory, it's safe to access the parent too.  Prior to 347c4a874710 (\"memcg: remove cgroup_event->cft\"), there was a call to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular cgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from __file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped the file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the invarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against renames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.  Fix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().  Now that cgroupfs is implemented through kernfs, checking the file operations needs to go through a layer of indirection.  Instead, let's check the superblock and dentry type.",
