  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path  mtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put() is called, destroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still being held in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along to DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare() if a suspend were triggered at that point, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying the object in the error path to prevent this from happening.",
