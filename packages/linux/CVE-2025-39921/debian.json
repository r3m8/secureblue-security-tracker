  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: microchip-core-qspi: stop checking viability of op->max_freq in supports_op callback  In commit 13529647743d9 (\"spi: microchip-core-qspi: Support per spi-mem operation frequency switches\") the logic for checking the viability of op->max_freq in mchp_coreqspi_setup_clock() was copied into mchp_coreqspi_supports_op(). Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid when this function is called during probe but is instead zero. Accordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division by zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.  Seemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a modification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq capability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.",
