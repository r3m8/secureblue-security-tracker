  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create  The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.  This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with list_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of added elements after the array is filled.",
