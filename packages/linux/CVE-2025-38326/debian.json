  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: clean device rq_list in aoedev_downdev()  An aoe device's rq_list contains accepted block requests that are waiting to be transmitted to the aoe target. This queue was added as part of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned out when an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleep indefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. This fix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().",
