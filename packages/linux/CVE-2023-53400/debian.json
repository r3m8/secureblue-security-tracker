  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: Fix Oops by 9.1 surround channel names  get_line_out_pfx() may trigger an Oops by overflowing the static array with more than 8 channels.  This was reported for MacBookPro 12,1 with Cirrus codec.  As a workaround, extend for the 9.1 channels and also fix the potential Oops by unifying the code paths accessing the same array with the proper size check.",
