  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: Fix pd UAF once and for all  There is a race condition/UAF in padata_reorder that goes back to the initial commit.  A reference count is taken at the start of the process in padata_do_parallel, and released at the end in padata_serial_worker.  This reference count is (and only is) required for padata_replace to function correctly.  If padata_replace is never called then there is no issue.  In the function padata_reorder which serves as the core of padata, as soon as padata is added to queue->serial.list, and the associated spin lock released, that padata may be processed and the reference count on pd would go away.  Fix this by getting the next padata before the squeue->serial lock is released.  In order to make this possible, simplify padata_reorder by only calling it once the next padata arrives.",
