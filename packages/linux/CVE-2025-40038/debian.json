  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid  Skip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP isn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must decode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the next RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading guest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e. can sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs disabled.
