  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential hang in nilfs_detach_log_writer()  Syzbot has reported a potential hang in nilfs_detach_log_writer() called during nilfs2 unmount.  Analysis revealed that this is because nilfs_segctor_sync(), which synchronizes with the log writer thread, can be called after nilfs_segctor_destroy() terminates that thread, as shown in the call trace below:  nilfs_detach_log_writer   nilfs_segctor_destroy     nilfs_segctor_kill_thread  --> Shut down log writer thread     flush_work       nilfs_iput_work_func         nilfs_dispose_list           iput             nilfs_evict_inode               nilfs_transaction_commit                 nilfs_construct_segment (if inode needs sync)                   nilfs_segctor_sync  --> Attempt to synchronize with                                           log writer thread                            *** DEADLOCK ***  Fix this issue by changing nilfs_segctor_sync() so that the log writer thread returns normally without synchronizing after it terminates, and by forcing tasks that are already waiting to complete once after the thread terminates.  The skipped inode metadata flushout will then be processed together in the subsequent cleanup work in nilfs_segctor_destroy().",
