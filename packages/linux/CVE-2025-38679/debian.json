  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check  Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable number of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicated by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the payload size is not being validated against the actual message length.  This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides a property count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such a condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks if memory beyond the buffer is accessed.  Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload before each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are parsed.  This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received message buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware behavior.",
