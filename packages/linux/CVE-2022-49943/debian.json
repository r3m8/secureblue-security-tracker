The mutex is only meant to protect udc->driver along with a few other things.  As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be held while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind routine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts for link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the dwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)  Gadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though usb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a window in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is released and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred during that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine before its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be necessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget driver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be; currently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check will have to be added later.  Some degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(), which can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a sysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device lock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that the device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding, this will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive with any changes to udc->driver.  Lastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the udc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs protection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and unlock calls are added.",
