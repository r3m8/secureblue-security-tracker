  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix order >= MAX_ORDER warning due to crafted negative i_size  As syzbot reported [1], the root cause is that i_size field is a signed type, and negative i_size is also less than EROFS_BLKSIZ. As a consequence, it's handled as fast symlink unexpectedly.  Let's fall back to the generic path to deal with such unusual i_size.
