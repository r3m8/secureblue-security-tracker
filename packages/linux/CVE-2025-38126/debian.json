  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: make sure that ptp_rate is not 0 before configuring timestamping  The stmmac platform drivers that do not open-code the clk_ptp_rate value after having retrieved the default one from the device-tree can end up with 0 in clk_ptp_rate (as clk_get_rate can return 0). It will eventually propagate up to PTP initialization when bringing up the interface, leading to a divide by 0:   Division by zero in kernel.
