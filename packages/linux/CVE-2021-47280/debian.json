  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()  There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due to retrieving file_priv->master prior to locking the device's master mutex.  An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error found by Syzbot: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803  In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently freed before the mutex was unlocked.  To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot reproducer test.",
