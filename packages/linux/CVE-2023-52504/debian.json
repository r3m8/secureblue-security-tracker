  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()  Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on a 5-level paging machine:  \tBUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching() \tRead of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0 \t... \t__asan_load4() \trcu_is_watching() \ttrace_hardirqs_on() \ttext_poke_early() \tapply_alternatives() \t...  On machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57) gets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().  KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.  Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.
