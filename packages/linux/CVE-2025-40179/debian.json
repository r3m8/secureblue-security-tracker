  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: verify orphan file size is not too big  In principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However orphan replay needs to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus filesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of memory consumed. Limit orphan file size to a sane value and also use kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid large order allocations for sane but large orphan files.",
