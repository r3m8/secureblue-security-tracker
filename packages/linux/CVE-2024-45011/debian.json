  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device  Ensure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that the driver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.  All XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint at address 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().  On top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT endpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced from a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device while probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().  A XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data towards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This is why setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints.",
