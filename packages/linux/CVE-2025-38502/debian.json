  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage  Lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the runtime context:    ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);   storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];    if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)     ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];   else     ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);  For the second program which was called from the originally attached one, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former program's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result in an unintended out-of-bounds access.  To fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of storage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original program if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or ii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not using any of the cgroup local storage maps.",
