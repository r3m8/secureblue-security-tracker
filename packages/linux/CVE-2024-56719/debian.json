  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops  Commit 66600fac7a98 (\"net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data\") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().  The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to dma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that the dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value returned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment later, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as \"des\" is offset by proto_hdr_len.  This causes problems such as:    dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failed  and with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:    DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes]  Fix this by maintaining \"des\" as the original DMA cookie, and use tso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().
