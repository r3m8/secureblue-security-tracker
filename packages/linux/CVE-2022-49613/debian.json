  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: 8250: Fix PM usage_count for console handover  When console is enabled, univ8250_console_setup() calls serial8250_console_setup() before .dev is set to uart_port. Therefore, it will not call pm_runtime_get_sync(). Later, when the actual driver is going to take over univ8250_console_exit() is called. As .dev is already set, serial8250_console_exit() makes pm_runtime_put_sync() call with usage count being zero triggering PM usage count warning (extra debug for univ8250_console_setup(), univ8250_console_exit(), and serial8250_register_ports()):  [    0.068987] univ8250_console_setup ttyS0 nodev [    0.499670] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled [    0.717955] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread started [    1.960163] serial8250_register_ports assigned dev for ttyS0 [    1.976830] printk: console [ttyS0] disabled [    1.976888] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread stopped [    1.977073] univ8250_console_exit ttyS0 usage:0 [    1.977075] serial8250 serial8250: Runtime PM usage count underflow!

This problem became apparent only recently because 82586a721595 (\"PM: runtime: Avoid device usage count underflows\") added the warning printout. I confirmed this problem also occurs with v5.18 (w/o the warning printout, obviously).",
