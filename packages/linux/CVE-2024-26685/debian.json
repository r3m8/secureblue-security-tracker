  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write  According to a syzbot report, end_buffer_async_write(), which handles the completion of block device writes, may detect abnormal condition of the buffer async_write flag and cause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2.  Nilfs2 itself does not use end_buffer_async_write().  But, the async_write flag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issue with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\") as a means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the resulting crash.  This modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree node blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was irrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary and super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  This led to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write would fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backing device occurred in parallel.  The use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already been removed in a previous change.  Fix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag for the remaining super root block buffer.",
