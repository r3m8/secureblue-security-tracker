  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcounting  The kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() and page_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the release path (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.  This is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page() references are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc() references are stored directly in the given page. On release the folio page will be dereferenced too many times.  This was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when the served file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support (commit 49b29a573da8 (\"nfs: add support for large folios\")).",
