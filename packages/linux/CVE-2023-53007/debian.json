  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Make sure trace_printk() can output as soon as it can be used  Currently trace_printk() can be used as soon as early_trace_init() is called from start_kernel(). But if a crash happens, and \"ftrace_dump_on_oops\" is set on the kernel command line, all you get will be:    [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 347519us : Unknown type 6   [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 353141us : Unknown type 6   [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 358684us : Unknown type 6  This is because the trace_printk() event (type 6) hasn't been registered yet. That gets done via an early_initcall(), which may be early, but not early enough.  Instead of registering the trace_printk() event (and other ftrace events, which are not trace events) via an early_initcall(), have them registered at the same time that trace_printk() can be used. This way, if there is a crash before early_initcall(), then the trace_printk()s will actually be useful.",
