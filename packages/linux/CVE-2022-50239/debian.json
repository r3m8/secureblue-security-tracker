  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpufreq: qcom: fix writes in read-only memory region  This commit fixes a kernel oops because of a write in some read-only memory:  \t[    9.068287] Unable to handle kernel write to read-only memory at virtual address ffff800009240ad8 \t..snip.. \t[    9.138790] Internal error: Oops: 9600004f [#1] PREEMPT SMP \t..snip.. \t[    9.269161] Call trace: \t[    9.276271]  __memcpy+0x5c/0x230 \t[    9.278531]  snprintf+0x58/0x80 \t[    9.282002]  qcom_cpufreq_msm8939_name_version+0xb4/0x190 \t[    9.284869]  qcom_cpufreq_probe+0xc8/0x39c \t..snip..  The following line defines a pointer that point to a char buffer stored in read-only memory:  \tchar *pvs_name = \"speedXX-pvsXX-vXX\";  This pointer is meant to hold a template \"speedXX-pvsXX-vXX\" where the XX values get overridden by the qcom_cpufreq_krait_name_version function. Since the template is actually stored in read-only memory, when the function executes the following call we get an oops:  \tsnprintf(*pvs_name, sizeof(\"speedXX-pvsXX-vXX\"), \"speed%d-pvs%d-v%d\", \t\t speed, pvs, pvs_ver);  To fix this issue, we instead store the template name onto the stack by using the following syntax:  \tchar pvs_name_buffer[] = \"speedXX-pvsXX-vXX\";  Because the `pvs_name` needs to be able to be assigned to NULL, the template buffer is stored in the pvs_name_buffer and not under the pvs_name variable.",
