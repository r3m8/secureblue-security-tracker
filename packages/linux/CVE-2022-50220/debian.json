  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect  usbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may sleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in ->ndo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic commit \"[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock\":    https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c  The change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex held in ->ndo_stop().  The commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a use-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c, ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:  * If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before   disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)   ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent(). * usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,   which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}(). * That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().  Because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(), netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.  In 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf (\"drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()\").  Unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to ->ndo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last.",
