  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi: Move unregister out of atomic section  Commit '9329933699b3 (\"soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Make client-lock non-sleeping\")' moved the pmic_glink client list under a spinlock, as it is accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback, which in turn is invoked from IRQ context.  This means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context, which isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort is under way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context, but until then lets schedule the unregistration.  A side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen after the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, is gone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL pointer dereference. This does however result in the user being informed about this error by the following entry in the kernel log:    ucsi_glink.pmic_glink_ucsi pmic_glink.ucsi.0: failed to send UCSI write request: -5",
