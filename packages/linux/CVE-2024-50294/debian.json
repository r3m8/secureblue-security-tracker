  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls  If a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being queued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort will be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from local->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock being held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race occurs.  Fix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever list its ->wait_link happens to be on.",
