  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: codecs: wcd9335: Fix missing free of regulator supplies  Driver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path (wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset()), but does not cleanup in final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  This leads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count during probe errors or unbind.  Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable() which also greatly simplifies the code.",
