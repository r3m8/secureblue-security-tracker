  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: fix monitor mode crash with sdio driver  mt7921s driver may receive frames with fragment buffers. If there is a CTS packet received in monitor mode, the payload is 10 bytes only and need 6 bytes header padding after RXD buffer. However, only RXD in the first linear buffer, if we pull buffer size RXD-size+6 bytes with skb_pull(), that would trigger \"BUG_ON(skb->len < skb->data_len)\" in __skb_pull().  To avoid the nonlinear buffer issue, enlarge the RXD size from 128 to 256 to make sure all MCU operation in linear buffer.  [   52.007562] kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:2313!
