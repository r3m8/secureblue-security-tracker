  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callback  Syzkaller has reported a general protection fault at function ir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointer dereference of dev->raw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL in the same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs due to the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function: rc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev->raw pointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only after that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.  If rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler is not finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thus rc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
