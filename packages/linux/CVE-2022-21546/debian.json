  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target: Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash  In newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates there is no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands like \"sg_write_same --ndob\" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file's execute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg because its NULL.  This patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code because we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in each handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with no data buffer.",
