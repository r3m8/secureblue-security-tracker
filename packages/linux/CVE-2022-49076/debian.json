  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/hfi1: Fix use-after-free bug for mm struct  Under certain conditions, such as MPI_Abort, the hfi1 cleanup code may represent the last reference held on the task mm. hfi1_mmu_rb_unregister() then drops the last reference and the mm is freed before the final use in hfi1_release_user_pages().  A new task may allocate the mm structure while it is still being used, resulting in problems. One manifestation is corruption of the mmap_sem counter leading to a hang in down_write().  Another is corruption of an mm struct that is in use by another task.",
