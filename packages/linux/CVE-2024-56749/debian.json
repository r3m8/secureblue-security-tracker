  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dlm: fix dlm_recover_members refcount on error  If dlm_recover_members() fails we don't drop the references of the previous created root_list that holds and keep all rsbs alive during the recovery. It might be not an unlikely event because ping_members() could run into an -EINTR if another recovery progress was triggered again.",
