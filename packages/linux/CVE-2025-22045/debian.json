  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range() when used for zapping normal PMDs  On the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for zapping normal PMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE entries in the pointed-to page table:      collapse_pte_mapped_thp       pmdp_collapse_flush         flush_tlb_range  The arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can be used for page table removal, and does not use any last-level invalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by making it behave the same way.  Currently, X86 only uses this information for the following two purposes, which I think means the issue doesn't have much impact:   - In native_flush_tlb_multi() for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be    IPI'd to avoid issues with speculative page table walks.  - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.  The patch \"x86/mm: only invalidate final translations with INVLPGB\" which is currently under review (see <https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241230175550.4046587-13-riel@surriel.com/>) would probably be making the impact of this a lot worse.",
