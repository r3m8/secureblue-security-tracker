  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix rq-qos breakage from skipping rq_qos_done_bio()  a647a524a467 (\"block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked\") made bio_endio() skip rq_qos_done_bio() if BIO_TRACKED is not set. While this fixed a potential oops, it also broke blk-iocost by skipping the done_bio callback for merged bios.  Before, whether a bio goes through rq_qos_throttle() or rq_qos_merge(), rq_qos_done_bio() would be called on the bio on completion with BIO_TRACKED distinguishing the former from the latter. rq_qos_done_bio() is not called for bios which wenth through rq_qos_merge(). This royally confuses blk-iocost as the merged bios never finish and are considered perpetually in-flight.  One reliably reproducible failure mode is an intermediate cgroup geting stuck active preventing its children from being activated due to the leaf-only rule, leading to loss of control. The following is from resctl-bench protection scenario which emulates isolating a web server like workload from a memory bomb run on an iocost configuration which should yield a reasonable level of protection.    # cat /sys/block/nvme2n1/device/model   Samsung SSD 970 PRO 512GB   # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.model   259:0 ctrl=user model=linear rbps=834913556 rseqiops=93622 rrandiops=102913 wbps=618985353 wseqiops=72325 wrandiops=71025   # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.qos   259:0 enable=1 ctrl=user rpct=95.00 rlat=18776 wpct=95.00 wlat=8897 min=60.00 max=100.00   # resctl-bench -m 29.6G -r out.json run protection::scenario=mem-hog,loops=1   ...

Fix it by introducing a new flag BIO_QOS_MERGED to mark merged bios and calling rq_qos_done_bio() on them too. For consistency and clarity, rename BIO_TRACKED to BIO_QOS_THROTTLED. The flag checks are moved into rq_qos_done_bio() so that it's next to the code paths that set the flags.  With the patch applied, the above same benchmark shows:    # resctl-bench -m 29.6G -r out.json run protection::scenario=mem-hog,loops=1   ...
