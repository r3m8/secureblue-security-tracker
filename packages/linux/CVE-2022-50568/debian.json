  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: f_hid: fix f_hidg lifetime vs cdev  The embedded struct cdev does not have its lifetime correctly tied to the enclosing struct f_hidg, so there is a use-after-free if /dev/hidgN is held open while the gadget is deleted.  This can readily be replicated with libusbgx's example programs (for conciseness - operating directly via configfs is equivalent):  \tgadget-hid \texec 3<> /dev/hidg0 \tgadget-vid-pid-remove \texec 3<&-  Pull the existing device up in to struct f_hidg and make use of the cdev_device_{add,del}() helpers.  This changes the lifetime of the device object to match struct f_hidg, but note that it is still added and deleted at the same time.",
