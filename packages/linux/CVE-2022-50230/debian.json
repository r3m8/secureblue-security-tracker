  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: set UXN on swapper page tables  [ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 (\"arm64:   head: cover entire kernel image in initial ID map\") as part of a   large refactoring of the arm64 boot flow. This simple fix is therefore   preferred for -stable backporting ]  On a system that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap is denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result, idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing __idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.",
