  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)  I found that the read code might send multiple requests using the same nfs_pgio_header, but nfs4_proc_read_setup() is only called once. This is how we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but also means we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratch buffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copy something to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUS hole segments.  I fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. I provide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies, and free the scratch buffer when the nfs_pgio_header is freed.",
