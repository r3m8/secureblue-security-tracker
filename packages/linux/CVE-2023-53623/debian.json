  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/swap: fix swap_info_struct race between swapoff and get_swap_pages()  The si->lock must be held when deleting the si from the available list.  Otherwise, another thread can re-add the si to the available list, which can lead to memory corruption.  The only place we have found where this happens is in the swapoff path.  This case can be described as below:  core 0                       core 1 swapoff  del_from_avail_list(si)      waiting  try lock si->lock            acquire swap_avail_lock                              and re-add si into                              swap_avail_head  acquire si->lock but missing si already being added again, and continuing to clear SWP_WRITEOK, etc.  It can be easily found that a massive warning messages can be triggered inside get_swap_pages() by some special cases, for example, we call madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT) on blocks of touched memory concurrently, meanwhile, run much swapon-swapoff operations (e.g.  stress-ng-swap).  However, in the worst case, panic can be caused by the above scene.  In swapoff(), the memory used by si could be kept in swap_info[] after turning off a swap.  This means memory corruption will not be caused immediately until allocated and reset for a new swap in the swapon path.  A panic message caused: (with CONFIG_PLIST_DEBUG enabled)  ------------[ cut here ]------------ top: 00000000e58a3003, n: 0000000013e75cda, p: 000000008cd4451a prev: 0000000035b1e58a, n: 000000008cd4451a, p: 000000002150ee8d next: 000000008cd4451a, n: 000000008cd4451a, p: 000000008cd4451a WARNING: CPU: 21 PID: 1843 at lib/plist.c:60 plist_check_prev_next_node+0x50/0x70 Modules linked in: rfkill(E) crct10dif_ce(E)...
