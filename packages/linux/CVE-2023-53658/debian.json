  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: bcm-qspi: return error if neither hif_mspi nor mspi is available  If neither a \"hif_mspi\" nor \"mspi\" resource is present, the driver will just early exit in probe but still return success. Apart from not doing anything meaningful, this would then also lead to a null pointer access on removal, as platform_get_drvdata() would return NULL, which it would then try to dereference when trying to unregister the spi master.  Fix this by unconditionally calling devm_ioremap_resource(), as it can handle a NULL res and will then return a viable ERR_PTR() if we get one.  The \"return 0;\" was previously a \"goto qspi_resource_err;\" where then ret was returned, but since ret was still initialized to 0 at this place this was a valid conversion in 63c5395bb7a9 (\"spi: bcm-qspi: Fix use-after-free on unbind\"). The issue was not introduced by this commit, only made more obvious.",
