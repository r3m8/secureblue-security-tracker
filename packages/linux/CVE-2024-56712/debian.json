  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path  In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handling in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about the containing dma_buf.  This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; though that doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.  Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling.  Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (\"udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios\"); but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.",
