  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()  When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported actually when connected with a bad adapter.  Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner cases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.  (cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)",
