  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rcu/nocb: Fix possible invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer access  In the preparation stage of CPU online, if the corresponding the rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread does not exist, will be created, there is a situation where the rdp's rcuop kthreads creation fails, and then de-offload this CPU's rdp, does not assign this CPU's rdp->nocb_cb_kthread pointer, but this rdp's->nocb_gp_rdp and rdp's->rdp_gp->nocb_gp_kthread is still valid.  This will cause the subsequent re-offload operation of this offline CPU, which will pass the conditional check and the kthread_unpark() will access invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer.  This commit therefore use rdp's->nocb_gp_kthread instead of rdp_gp's->nocb_gp_kthread for safety check.",
