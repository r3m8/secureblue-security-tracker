  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: iris: Fix memory leak by freeing untracked persist buffer  One internal buffer which is allocated only once per session was not being freed during session close because it was not being tracked as part of internal buffer list which resulted in a memory leak.  Add the necessary logic to explicitly free the untracked internal buffer during session close to ensure all allocated memory is released properly.",
