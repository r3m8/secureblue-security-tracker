  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efivarfs: Fix memory leak of efivarfs_fs_info in fs_context error paths  When processing mount options, efivarfs allocates efivarfs_fs_info (sfi) early in fs_context initialization. However, sfi is associated with the superblock and typically freed when the superblock is destroyed. If the fs_context is released (final put) before fill_super is called\u2014such as on error paths or during reconfiguration\u2014the sfi structure would leak, as ownership never transfers to the superblock.  Implement the .free callback in efivarfs_context_ops to ensure any allocated sfi is properly freed if the fs_context is torn down before fill_super, preventing this memory leak.",
