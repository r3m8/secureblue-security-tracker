  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  stmmac: intel: Add a missing clk_disable_unprepare() call in intel_eth_pci_remove()  Commit 09f012e64e4b (\"stmmac: intel: Fix clock handling on error and remove paths\") removed this clk_disable_unprepare()  This was partly revert by commit ac322f86b56c (\"net: stmmac: Fix clock handling on remove path\") which removed this clk_disable_unprepare() because: \"    While unloading the dwmac-intel driver, clk_disable_unprepare() is    being called twice in stmmac_dvr_remove() and    intel_eth_pci_remove(). This causes kernel panic on the second call. \"  However later on, commit 5ec55823438e8 (\"net: stmmac: add clocks management for gmac driver\") has updated stmmac_dvr_remove() which do not call clk_disable_unprepare() anymore.  So this call should now be called from intel_eth_pci_remove().",
