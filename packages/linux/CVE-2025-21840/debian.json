  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI header  The intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY attribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (\"thermal: netlink: Add the commands and the events for the thresholds\").  The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value was changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.  Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and use the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit itself is questionable.  The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr, which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks and unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event users.  Solve the issue by moving the newly introduced THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the enum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic netlink attributes remain unaffected.  [ rjw: Subject edits ]",
