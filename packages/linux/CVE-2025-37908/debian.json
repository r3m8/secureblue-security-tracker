  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm, slab: clean up slab->obj_exts always  When memory allocation profiling is disabled at runtime or due to an error, shutdown_mem_profiling() is called: slab->obj_exts which previously allocated remains. It won't be cleared by unaccount_slab() because of mem_alloc_profiling_enabled() not true. It's incorrect, slab->obj_exts should always be cleaned up in unaccount_slab() to avoid following error:  [...]BUG: Bad page state in process... .. [...]page dumped because: page still charged to cgroup  [andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com: fold need_slab_obj_ext() into its only user]",
