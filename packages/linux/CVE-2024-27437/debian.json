  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ  Currently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie. devices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq() and subsequently disabled as necessary to align with the masked status flag.  This presents a window where the interrupt could fire between these events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice. This would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents nested enables through vfio.  Instead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx is never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.",
