  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/ksm: fix race with VMA iteration and mm_struct teardown  exit_mmap() will tear down the VMAs and maple tree with the mmap_lock held in write mode.  Ensure that the maple tree is still valid by checking ksm_test_exit() after taking the mmap_lock in read mode, but before the for_each_vma() iterator dereferences a destroyed maple tree.  Since the maple tree is destroyed, the flags telling lockdep to check an external lock has been cleared.  Skip the for_each_vma() iterator to avoid dereferencing a maple tree without the external lock flag, which would create a lockdep warning.",
