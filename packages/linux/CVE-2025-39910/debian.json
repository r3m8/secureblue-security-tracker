  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/vmalloc, mm/kasan: respect gfp mask in kasan_populate_vmalloc()  kasan_populate_vmalloc() and its helpers ignore the caller's gfp_mask and always allocate memory using the hardcoded GFP_KERNEL flag.  This makes them inconsistent with vmalloc(), which was recently extended to support GFP_NOFS and GFP_NOIO allocations.  Page table allocations performed during shadow population also ignore the external gfp_mask.  To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and GFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate memalloc scope.  xfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.  There was a report here https://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com  This patch:  - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;  - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();  - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()    around apply_to_page_range();  - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.",
