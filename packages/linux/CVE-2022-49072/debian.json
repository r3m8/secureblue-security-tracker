  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization  GPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely initialized and this leads to race conditions.  One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in Kernel NULL pointer dereference.  Following are the logs for reference :-  kernel: Call Trace: kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70 kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0 kernel:  i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0 kernel:  i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0 kernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460 kernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0  To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before they are completely initialized.",
