  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs: pass explicit offset/count to trace events  nfs_folio_length is unsafe to use without having the folio locked and a check for a NULL ->f_mapping that protects against truncations and can lead to kernel crashes.  E.g. when running xfstests generic/065 with all nfs trace points enabled.  Follow the model of the XFS trace points and pass in an expl\u0456cit offset and length.  This has the additional benefit that these values can be more accurate as some of the users touch partial folio ranges.",
