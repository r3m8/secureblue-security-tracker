  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu\"  There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c, but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).  This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which often serves as a baseline for products).  Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.  This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.",
