  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: Remove broken autobind  Binding AX25 socket by using the autobind feature leads to memory leaks in ax25_connect() and also refcount leaks in ax25_release(). Memory leak was detected with kmemleak:  ================================================================ unreferenced object 0xffff8880253cd680 (size 96): backtrace: __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof (./include/linux/kmemleak.h:43) kmemdup_noprof (mm/util.c:136) ax25_rt_autobind (net/ax25/ax25_route.c:428) ax25_connect (net/ax25/af_ax25.c:1282) __sys_connect_file (net/socket.c:2045) __sys_connect (net/socket.c:2064) __x64_sys_connect (net/socket.c:2067) do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130) ================================================================  When socket is bound, refcounts must be incremented the way it is done in ax25_bind() and ax25_setsockopt() (SO_BINDTODEVICE). In case of autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.  This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:  ================================================================ ax25_connect(): syz-executor318 uses autobind, please contact jreuter@yaina.de ------------[ cut here ]------------ refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.

It is broken.\"; \"autobinding in this may or may not work\"; - it is better to completely remove this feature than to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs.  Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
