  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nouveau/uvmm: fix addr/range calcs for remap operations  dEQP-VK.sparse_resources.image_rebind.2d_array.r64i.128_128_8 was causing a remap operation like the below.  op_remap: prev: 0000003fffed0000 00000000000f0000 00000000a5abd18a 0000000000000000 op_remap: next: op_remap: unmap: 0000003fffed0000 0000000000100000 0 op_map: map: 0000003ffffc0000 0000000000010000 000000005b1ba33c 00000000000e0000  This was resulting in an unmap operation from 0x3fffed0000+0xf0000, 0x100000 which was corrupting the pagetables and oopsing the kernel.  Fixes the prev + unmap range calcs to use start/end and map back to addr/range.",
