  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free KFENCE violation during sysfs firmware write  During the sysfs firmware write process, a use-after-free read warning is logged from the lpfc_wr_object() routine:    BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in lpfc_wr_object+0x235/0x310 [lpfc]   Use-after-free read at 0x0000000000cf164d (in kfence-#111):   lpfc_wr_object+0x235/0x310 [lpfc]   lpfc_write_firmware.cold+0x206/0x30d [lpfc]   lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update+0xa6/0x100 [lpfc]   lpfc_request_firmware_upgrade_store+0x66/0xb0 [lpfc]   kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x121/0x1b0   new_sync_write+0x11c/0x1b0   vfs_write+0x1ef/0x280   ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0   do_syscall_64+0x59/0x90   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd  The driver accessed wr_object pointer data, which was initialized into mailbox payload memory, after the mailbox object was released back to the mailbox pool.  Fix by moving the mailbox free calls to the end of the routine ensuring that we don't reference internal mailbox memory after release.",
