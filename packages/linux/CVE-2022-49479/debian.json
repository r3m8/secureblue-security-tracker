  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: fix tx status related use-after-free race on station removal  There is a small race window where ongoing tx activity can lead to a skb getting added to the status tracking idr after that idr has already been cleaned up, which will keep the wcid linked in the status poll list. Fix this by only adding status skbs if the wcid pointer is still assigned in dev->wcid, which gets cleared early by mt76_sta_pre_rcu_remove",
