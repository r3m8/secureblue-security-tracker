  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/ttm: fix CCS handling  Crucible + recent Mesa seems to sometimes hit:  GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER)  And it looks like we can also trigger this with gem_lmem_swapping, if we modify the test to use slightly larger object sizes.  Looking closer it looks like we have the following issues in migrate_copy():    - We are using plain integer in various places, which we can easily     overflow with a large object.    - We pass the entire object size (when the src is lmem) into     emit_pte() and then try to copy it, which doesn't work, since we     only have a few fixed sized windows in which to map the pages and     perform the copy. With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly     copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the     GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).  So it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our CHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.  Testcase: igt@gem_lmem_swapping (cherry picked from commit 8676145eb2f53a9940ff70910caf0125bd8a4bc2)",
