  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: multitouch: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name  Reference the HID device rather than the input device for the devm allocation of the input_dev name. Referencing the input_dev would lead to a use-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a uevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the name would be freed by devres management.  Use devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and formatting the input_dev name string.",
