  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race  fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info->bat, which gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:    info->bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &fuel_gauge_desc, &psy_cfg);  As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add() the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window where fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while info->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed the power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat, so fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use the passed in psy argument which is always valid.",
