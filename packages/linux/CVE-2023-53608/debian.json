  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()  The finalization of nilfs_segctor_thread() can race with nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() which terminates that thread, potentially causing a use-after-free BUG as KASAN detected.  At the end of nilfs_segctor_thread(), it assigns NULL to \"sc_task\" member of \"struct nilfs_sc_info\" to indicate the thread has finished, and then notifies nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() of this using waitqueue \"sc_wait_task\" on the struct nilfs_sc_info.  However, here, immediately after the NULL assignment to \"sc_task\", it is possible that nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() will detect it and return to continue the deallocation, freeing the nilfs_sc_info structure before the thread does the notification.  This fixes the issue by protecting the NULL assignment to \"sc_task\" and its notification, with spinlock \"sc_state_lock\" of the struct nilfs_sc_info.  Since nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() does a final check to see if \"sc_task\" is NULL with \"sc_state_lock\" locked, this can eliminate the race.",
