That is, as the rtl8712 driver was being unbound from a composite device in preparation for an unrelated USB reset (that driver does not have pre_reset or post_reset callbacks), its ->remove routine called usb_reset_device() -- thus nesting one reset call within another.  Performing a reset as part of disconnect processing is a questionable practice at best.  However, the bug report points out that the USB core does not have any protection against nested resets.  Adding a reset_in_progress flag and testing it will prevent such errors in the future.",
