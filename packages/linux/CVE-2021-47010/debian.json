  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo  tcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets ca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced. This has the unintended side-effect of changing the global net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that it is read-only: 97684f0970f6 (\"net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns\")  Resolve this netns \"leak\" by only allowing the init netns to set the default algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could be removed if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the future.  This bug was uncovered with https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify",
