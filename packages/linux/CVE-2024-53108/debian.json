  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay feature  At some point, the IEEE ID identification for the replay check in the AMD EDID was added. However, this check causes the following out-of-bounds issues when using KASAN:  [   27.804016] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in amdgpu_dm_update_freesync_caps+0xefa/0x17a0 [amdgpu] [   27.804788] Read of size 1 at addr ffff8881647fdb00 by task systemd-udevd/383  ...

This commit addresses this issue by considering the amd_vsdb_block size.  (cherry picked from commit b7e381b1ccd5e778e3d9c44c669ad38439a861d8)",
