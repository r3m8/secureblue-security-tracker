  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks  The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume(). Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.  Those helpers have two roles currently:  - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.  - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It    requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.  Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two however has two implications:  - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context    where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where    the usage count is incremented).  - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.  Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:  spi_mem_exec_op()         ...         spi_mem_access_start()                 mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)          cqspi_exec_mem_op()                 pm_runtime_resume_and_get()                         cqspi_resume()                                 spi_controller_resume()                                         mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)                 ...          spi_mem_access_end()                 mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)         ...",
