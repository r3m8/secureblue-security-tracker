  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: isotp: split tx timer into transmission and timeout  The timer for the transmission of isotp PDUs formerly had two functions: 1. send two consecutive frames with a given time gap 2. monitor the timeouts for flow control frames and the echo frames  This led to larger txstate checks and potentially to a problem discovered by syzbot which enabled the panic_on_warn feature while testing.  The former 'txtimer' function is split into 'txfrtimer' and 'txtimer' to handle the two above functionalities with separate timer callbacks.  The two simplified timers now run in one-shot mode and make the state transitions (especially with isotp_rcv_echo) better understandable.",
