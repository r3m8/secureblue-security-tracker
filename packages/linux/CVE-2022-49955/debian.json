  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/rtas: Fix RTAS MSR[HV] handling for Cell  The semi-recent changes to MSR handling when entering RTAS (firmware) cause crashes on IBM Cell machines. An example trace:    kernel tried to execute user page (2fff01a8) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)   BUG: Unable to handle kernel instruction fetch   Faulting instruction address: 0x2fff01a8   Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]   BE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Hash SMP NR_CPUS=4 NUMA Cell   Modules linked in:   CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G        W          6.0.0-rc2-00433-gede0a8d3307a #207   NIP:  000000002fff01a8 LR: 0000000000032608 CTR: 0000000000000000   REGS: c0000000015236b0 TRAP: 0400   Tainted: G        W           (6.0.0-rc2-00433-gede0a8d3307a)   MSR:  0000000008001002 <ME,RI>  CR: 00000000  XER: 20000000   ...

Fix it by copying the MSR[HV] bit from the MSR value we've just read using mfmsr into the value used for RTAS.  It seems like we could also fix it using an #ifdef CELL to set MSR[HV], but that doesn't work because it's possible to build a single kernel image that runs on both Cell native and pseries.",
