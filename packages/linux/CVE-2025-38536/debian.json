  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: airoha: fix potential use-after-free in airoha_npu_get()  np->name was being used after calling of_node_put(np), which releases the node and can lead to a use-after-free bug. Previously, of_node_put(np) was called unconditionally after of_find_device_by_node(np), which could result in a use-after-free if pdev is NULL.  This patch moves of_node_put(np) after the error check to ensure the node is only released after both the error and success cases are handled appropriately, preventing potential resource issues.",
