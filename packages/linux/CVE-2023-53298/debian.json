  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io  The callback context for sending/receiving APDUs to/from the selected secure element is allocated inside nfc_genl_se_io and supposed to be eventually freed in se_io_cb callback function. However, there are several error paths where the bwi_timer is not charged to call se_io_cb later, and the cb_context is leaked.  The patch proposes to free the cb_context explicitly on those error paths.  At the moment we can't simply check 'dev->ops->se_io()' return value as it may be negative in both cases: when the timer was charged and was not.",
