  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix possible int overflows in nilfs_fiemap()  Since nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig() in nilfs_fiemap() calculates its result by being prepared to go through potentially maxblocks == INT_MAX blocks, the value in n may experience an overflow caused by left shift of blkbits.  While it is extremely unlikely to occur, play it safe and cast right hand expression to wider type to mitigate the issue.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis tool SVACE.",
