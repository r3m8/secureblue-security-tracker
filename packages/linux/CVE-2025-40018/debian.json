  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipvs: Defer ip_vs_ftp unregister during netns cleanup  On the netns cleanup path, __ip_vs_ftp_exit() may unregister ip_vs_ftp before connections with valid cp->app pointers are flushed, leading to a use-after-free.  Fix this by introducing a global `exiting_module` flag, set to true in ip_vs_ftp_exit() before unregistering the pernet subsystem. In __ip_vs_ftp_exit(), skip ip_vs_ftp unregister if called during netns cleanup (when exiting_module is false) and defer it to __ip_vs_cleanup_batch(), which unregisters all apps after all connections are flushed. If called during module exit, unregister ip_vs_ftp immediately.",
