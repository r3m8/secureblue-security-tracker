  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Collect command failures data only for known commands  DEVX can issue a general command, which is not used by mlx5 driver. In case such command is failed, mlx5 is trying to collect the failure data, However, mlx5 doesn't create a storage for this command, since mlx5 doesn't use it. This lead to array-index-out-of-bounds error.  Fix it by checking whether the command is known before collecting the failure data.",
