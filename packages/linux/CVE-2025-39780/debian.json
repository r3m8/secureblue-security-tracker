  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switch  When enabling a sched_ext scheduler, we may trigger invalid task state transitions, resulting in warnings like the following (which can be easily reproduced by running the hotplug selftest in a loop):   sched_ext: Invalid task state transition 0 -> 3 for fish[770]  WARNING: CPU: 18 PID: 787 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3862 scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0  ...  RIP: 0010:scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0  ...  Call Trace:   <TASK>   scx_enable_task+0x11f/0x2e0   switching_to_scx+0x24/0x110   scx_enable.isra.0+0xd14/0x13d0   bpf_struct_ops_link_create+0x136/0x1a0   __sys_bpf+0x1edd/0x2c30   __x64_sys_bpf+0x21/0x30   do_syscall_64+0xbb/0x370   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f  This happens because we skip initialization for tasks that are already dead (with their usage counter set to zero), but we don't exclude them during the scheduling class transition phase.  Fix this by also skipping dead tasks during class swiching, preventing invalid task state transitions.",
