  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT  The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained. In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.  Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT (0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.",
