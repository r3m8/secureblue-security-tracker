  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error  The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure. Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that there was an error when the data read from the register was combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination sequence needs to be corrected.  Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to new kernel and may result in wrong data.  In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration, if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be updated.",
