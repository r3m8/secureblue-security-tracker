  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cacheinfo: Fix shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levels  The cacheinfo sets up the shared_cpu_map by checking whether the caches with the same index are shared between CPUs. However, this will trigger slab-out-of-bounds access if the CPUs do not have the same cache hierarchy. Another problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache does not have the same index between CPUs.  CPU0\tI\tD\tL3 index\t0\t1\t2\tx \t^\t^\t^\t^ index\t0\t1\t2\t3 CPU1\tI\tD\tL2\tL3  This patch checks each cache is shared with all caches on other CPUs.",
