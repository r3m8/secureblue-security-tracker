  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread  Patch series \"nilfs2: fix log writer related issues\".  This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues, including a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on unmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found during their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.   This patch (of 3):  A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure.  The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.  Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.",
