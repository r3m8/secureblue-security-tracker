  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe  This ioctl() implicitly assumed that the socket was already bound to a valid local socket name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not bound, two separate problems would occur:  1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid source object. 2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly being    connected yet not bound to a valid object.",
