  "description": "The UAMQP is a general purpose C library for AMQP 1.0. During a call to open_get_offered_capabilities, a memory allocation may fail causing a use-after-free issue and if a client called it during connection communication it may cause a remote code execution. Users are advised to update the submodule with commit `30865c9c`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
