  "description": "Heap out-of-bounds read in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data. The offset is later used in the length of a copy operation, without checking the upper bounds of the source of the copy operation.",
