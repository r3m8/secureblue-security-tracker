  "description": "The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\r \r An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.\r \r This resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.",
