  "description": "Mozilla developers Gabriele Svelto, Yulia Startsev, Andrew McCreight and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.<br />*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after discovering it was inadvertently left out of the original advisory. The fix was included in the original release of Firefox 107. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107.",
