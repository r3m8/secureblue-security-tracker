  "description": "Firefox could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified in an `embed` tag.  This could have bypassed website security checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to embed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 140, Firefox ESR < 128.12, Thunderbird < 140, and Thunderbird < 128.12.",
