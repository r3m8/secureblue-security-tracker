  "description": "A flaw has been found in Kamailio 5.5. The impacted element is the function rve_is_constant of the file src/core/rvalue.c. This manipulation causes null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be launched locally. The exploit has been published and may be used. It is still unclear if this vulnerability genuinely exists. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
