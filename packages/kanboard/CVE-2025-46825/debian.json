  "description": "Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.26 through 1.2.44 have a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in the `name` parameter of the `http://localhost/?controller=ProjectCreationController&action=create` form. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Note that the default content security policy (CSP) blocks the JavaScript attack, though it can be exploited if an instance is badly configured and the software is vulnerable to CSS injection because of the unsafe-inline on the default CSP. Version 1.2.45 contains a fix for the issue.",
