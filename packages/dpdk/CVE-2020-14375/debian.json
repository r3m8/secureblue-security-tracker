  "description": "A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. Virtio ring descriptors, and the data they describe are in a region of memory accessible by from both the virtual machine and the host. An attacker in a VM can change the contents of the memory after vhost_crypto has validated it. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
