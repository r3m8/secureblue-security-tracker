  "description": "A vulnerability was found in OpenSC, OpenSC tools, PKCS#11 module, minidriver, and CTK. An attacker could use a crafted USB Device or Smart Card, which would present the system with a specially crafted response to APDUs.   Insufficient or missing checking of return values of functions leads to unexpected work with variables that have not been initialized.",
