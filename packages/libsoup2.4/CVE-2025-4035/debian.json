  "description": "A flaw was found in libsoup. When handling cookies, libsoup clients mistakenly allow cookies to be set for public suffix domains if the domain contains at least two components and includes an uppercase character. This bypasses public suffix protections and could allow a malicious website to set cookies for domains it does not own, potentially leading to integrity issues such as session fixation.",
