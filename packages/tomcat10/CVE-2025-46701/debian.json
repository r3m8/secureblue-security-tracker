  "description": "Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's GCI servlet allows security constraint bypass of security constraints that apply to the pathInfo component of a URI mapped to the CGI servlet.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.6, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.40, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.104. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions  may also be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.7, 10.1.41 or 9.0.105, which fixes the issue.",
