  "description": "The Parse function permits values other than IPv6 addresses to be included in square brackets within the host component of a URL. RFC 3986 permits IPv6 addresses to be included within the host component, enclosed within square brackets. For example: \"http://[::1]/\". IPv4 addresses and hostnames must not appear within square brackets. Parse did not enforce this requirement.",
