  "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework.Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data. The vulnerability is found in `graphs_new.php`. Several validations are performed, but the `returnto` parameter is directly passed to `form_save_button`. In order to bypass this validation, returnto must contain `host.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.",
