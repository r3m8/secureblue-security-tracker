  "description": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding process of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1. Both the SPICE client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws. These flaws allow a malicious client or server to send specially crafted messages that, when processed by the QUIC image compression algorithm, result in a process crash or potential code execution.",
