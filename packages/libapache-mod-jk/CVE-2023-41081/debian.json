  "description": "Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081  The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors\u00a0in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included\u00a0\"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker.\u00a0Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the\u00a0status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As\u00a0of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all\u00a0mappings must now be via explicit configuration.\u00a0Only mod_jk is affected\u00a0by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.  History 2023-09-13 Original advisory  2023-09-28 Updated summary",
