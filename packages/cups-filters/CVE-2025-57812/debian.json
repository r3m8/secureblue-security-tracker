  "description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. In CUPS-Filters versions up to and including 1.28.17 and libscupsfilters versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.1, CUPS-Filters's `imagetoraster` filter has an out of bounds read/write vulnerability in the processing of TIFF image files.  While the pixel buffer is allocated with the number of pixels times a pre-calculated bytes-per-pixel value, the function which processes these pixels is called with a size of the number of pixels times 3.  When suitable inputs are passed, the bytes-per-pixel value can be set to 1 and bytes outside of the buffer bounds get processed. In order to trigger the bug, an attacker must issue a print job with a crafted TIFF file, and pass appropriate print job options to control the bytes-per-pixel value of the output format. They must choose a printer configuration under which the `imagetoraster` filter or its C-function equivalent `cfFilterImageToRaster()` gets invoked. The vulnerability exists in both CUPS-Filters 1.x and the successor library libcupsfilters (CUPS-Filters 2.x). In CUPS-Filters 2.x, the vulnerable function is `_cfImageReadTIFF() in libcupsfilters`. When this function is invoked as part of `cfFilterImageToRaster()`, the caller passes a look-up-table during whose processing the out of bounds memory access happens. In CUPS-Filters 1.x, the equivalent functions are all found in the cups-filters repository, which is not split into subprojects yet, and the vulnerable code is in `_cupsImageReadTIFF()`, which is called through `cupsImageOpen()` from the `imagetoraster` tool. A patch is available in commit b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa.",
