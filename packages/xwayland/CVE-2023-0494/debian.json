  "description": "A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This issue occurs due to a dangling pointer in DeepCopyPointerClasses that can be exploited by ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo() and ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo() to read and write into freed memory. This can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.",
