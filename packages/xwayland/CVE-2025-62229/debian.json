  "description": "A flaw was found in the X.Org X server and Xwayland when processing X11 Present extension notifications. Improper error handling during notification creation can leave dangling pointers that lead to a use-after-free condition. This can cause memory corruption or a crash, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.",
