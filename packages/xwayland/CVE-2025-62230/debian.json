  "description": "A flaw was discovered in the X.Org X server\u2019s X Keyboard (Xkb) extension when handling client resource cleanup. The software frees certain data structures without properly detaching related resources, leading to a use-after-free condition. This can cause memory corruption or a crash when affected clients disconnect.",
