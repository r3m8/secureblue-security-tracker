  "description": "A flaw has been found in GNU Binutils 2.45. Impacted is the function _bfd_elf_parse_eh_frame of the file bfd/elf-eh-frame.c of the component Linker. Executing manipulation can lead to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack is restricted to local execution. The exploit has been published and may be used. This patch is called ea1a0737c7692737a644af0486b71e4a392cbca8. A patch should be applied to remediate this issue. The code maintainer replied with \"[f]ixed for 2.46\".",
