  "description": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged regular user on the network can cause an out-of-bounds write through a specially crafted shader, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. The scope of the impact may extend to other components.",
