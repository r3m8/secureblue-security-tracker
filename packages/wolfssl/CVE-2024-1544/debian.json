  "description": "Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then  truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the  order of the elliptic curve. Meaning k = r mod n. The division used  during the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two  digits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of  n and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size.  Observing the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow  revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of  k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a  significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction  methods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits.",
