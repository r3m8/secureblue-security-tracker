  "description": "In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message.",
