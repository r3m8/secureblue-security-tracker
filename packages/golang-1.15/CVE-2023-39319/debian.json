  "description": "The html/template package does not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of \"<script\", \"<!--\", and \"</script\" within JS literals in <script> contexts. This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.",
