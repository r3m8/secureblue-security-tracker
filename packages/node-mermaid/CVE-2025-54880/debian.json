  "description": "Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. In the default configuration of mermaid 11.9.0 and earlier, user supplied input for architecture diagram icons is passed to the d3 html() method, creating a sink for cross site scripting. This vulnerability is fixed in 11.10.0.",
