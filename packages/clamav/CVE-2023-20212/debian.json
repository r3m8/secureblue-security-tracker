  "description": "A vulnerability in the AutoIt module of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. \r \r This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the memory management of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted AutoIt file to be scanned by ClamAV on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.",
