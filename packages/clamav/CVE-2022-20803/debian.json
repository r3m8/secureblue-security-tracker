  "description": "A vulnerability in the OLE2 file parser of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions 0.104.0 through 0.104.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device.The vulnerability is due to incorrect use of the realloc function that may result in a double-free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted OLE2 file to be scanned by ClamAV on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.",
