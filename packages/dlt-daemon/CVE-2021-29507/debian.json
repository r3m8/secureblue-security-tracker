  "description": "GENIVI Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT) provides a log and trace interface. In versions of GENIVI DLT between 2.10.0 and 2.18.6, a configuration file containing the special characters could cause a vulnerable component to crash. All the applications which are using the configuration file could fail to generate their dlt logs in system. As of time of publication, no patch exists. As a workaround, one may check the integrity of information in configuration file manually.",
