  "description": "FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. All FreeRDP based clients when using the `/video` command line switch might read uninitialized data, decode it as audio/video and display the result. FreeRDP based server implementations are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 2.8.1. If you cannot upgrade do not use the `/video` switch.",
