  "description": "In FreeRDP greater than 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in update_read_icon_info. It allows reading a attacker-defined amount of client memory (32bit unsigned -> 4GB) to an intermediate buffer. This can be used to crash the client or store information for later retrieval. This has been patched in 2.0.0.",
