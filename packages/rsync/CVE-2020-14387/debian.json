  "description": "A flaw was found in rsync in versions since 3.2.0pre1. Rsync improperly validates certificate with host mismatch vulnerability. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit the flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack using a valid certificate for another hostname which could compromise confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted using rsync-ssl. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. This flaw affects rsync versions before 3.2.4.",
