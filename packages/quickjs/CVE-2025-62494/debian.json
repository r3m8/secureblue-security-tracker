  "description": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in the handling of the string addition (+) operation within the QuickJS engine.    *  The code first checks if the left-hand operand is a string.     *  It then attempts to convert the right-hand operand to a primitive value using JS_ToPrimitiveFree. This conversion can trigger a callback (e.g., toString or valueOf).     *  During this callback, an attacker can modify the type of the left-hand operand in memory, changing it from a string to a different type (e.g., an object or an array).     *  The code then proceeds to call JS_ConcatStringInPlace, which still treats the modified left-hand value as a string.   This mismatch between the assumed type (string) and the actual type allows an attacker to control the data structure being processed by the concatenation logic, resulting in a type confusion condition. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution in the context of the QuickJS runtime.",
