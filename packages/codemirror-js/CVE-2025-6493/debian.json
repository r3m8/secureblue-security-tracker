  "description": "A weakness has been identified in CodeMirror up to 5.65.20. Affected is an unknown function of the file mode/markdown/markdown.js of the component Markdown Mode. This manipulation causes inefficient regular expression complexity. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. You should upgrade the affected component. Not all code samples mentioned in the GitHub issue can be found. The repository mentions, that \"CodeMirror 6 exists, and is [...] much more actively maintained.\"",
