  "description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of Expression/Command Delimiters vulnerability in Apache Commons OGNL.  This issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.    When using the API Ognl.getValue\u200b, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods,  etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive.  Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.  As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.   NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
