  "description": "When parsing the header for a DHAV file, there's an integer underflow in offset calculation that leads to reading the duration from before the start of the allocated buffer.  If we load a DHAV file that is larger than MAX_DURATION_BUFFER_SIZE\u00a0bytes (0x100000) for example 0x101000 bytes, then at [0] we have size = 0x101000. At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and at [2] we have end_buffer_pos = 0x1000.  The loop then scans backwards through the buffer looking for the dhav\u00a0tag; when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos\u00a0based on a 32-bit offset read from the buffer.  There is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos\u00a0is within the section of the file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles the cases where end_pos\u00a0is before the start of the file\u00a0or after the section copied into end_buffer, and not the case where end_pos\u00a0is within the the file, but before the section copied into end_buffer. If we provide such an offset, (end_pos - end_buffer_pos)\u00a0can underflow, resulting in the subsequent access at [4] occurring before the beginning of the allocation.  We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.",
