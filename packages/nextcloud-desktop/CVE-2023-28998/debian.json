Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.6.5, a malicious server administrator can gain full access to an end-to-end encrypted folder. They can decrypt files, recover the folder structure, and add new files.\u200b Users should upgrade the Nextcloud Desktop client to 3.6.5 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.",
