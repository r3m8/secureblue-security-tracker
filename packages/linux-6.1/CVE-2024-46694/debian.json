  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: avoid using null object of framebuffer  Instead of using state->fb->obj[0] directly, get object from framebuffer by calling drm_gem_fb_get_obj() and return error code when object is null to avoid using null object of framebuffer.  (cherry picked from commit 73dd0ad9e5dad53766ea3e631303430116f834b3)",
