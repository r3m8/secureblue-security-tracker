  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netlink: Fix wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.  Netlink has this pattern in some places    if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) > sk->sk_rcvbuf)   \tatomic_add(skb->truesize, &sk->sk_rmem_alloc);  , which has the same problem fixed by commit 5a465a0da13e (\"udp: Fix multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.\").  For example, if we set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUFFORCE, the condition is always false as the two operands are of int.  Then, a single socket can eat as many skb as possible until OOM happens, and we can see multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.  Let's fix it by using atomic_add_return() and comparing the two variables as unsigned int.
