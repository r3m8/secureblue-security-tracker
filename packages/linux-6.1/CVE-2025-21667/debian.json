  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iomap: avoid avoid truncating 64-bit offset to 32 bits  on 32-bit kernels, iomap_write_delalloc_scan() was inadvertently using a 32-bit position due to folio_next_index() returning an unsigned long. This could lead to an infinite loop when writing to an xfs filesystem.",
