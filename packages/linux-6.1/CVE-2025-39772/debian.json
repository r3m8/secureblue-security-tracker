  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/hisilicon/hibmc: fix the hibmc loaded failed bug  When hibmc loaded failed, the driver use hibmc_unload to free the resource, but the mutexes in mode.config are not init, which will access an NULL pointer. Just change goto statement to return, because hibnc_hw_init() doesn't need to free anything.",
