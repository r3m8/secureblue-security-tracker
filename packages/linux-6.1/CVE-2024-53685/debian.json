  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: give up on paths longer than PATH_MAX  If the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to be longer than PATH_MAX, then this function will enter an endless (retry) loop, effectively blocking the whole task.  Most of the machine becomes unusable, making this a very simple and effective DoS vulnerability.  I cannot imagine why this retry was ever implemented, but it seems rather useless and harmful to me.  Let's remove it and fail with ENAMETOOLONG instead.",
