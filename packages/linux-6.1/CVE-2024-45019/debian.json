  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Take state lock during tx timeout reporter  mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels() requires the state lock taken. The referenced changed in the Fixes tag removed the lock to fix another issue. This patch adds it back but at a later point (when calling mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()) to avoid the deadlock referenced in the Fixes tag.",
