  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex.  Fix the following deadlock: CPU A _free_event()   perf_kprobe_destroy()     mutex_lock(&event_mutex)       perf_trace_event_unreg()         synchronize_rcu_tasks_trace()  There are several paths where _free_event() grabs event_mutex and calls sync_rcu_tasks_trace. Above is one such case.  CPU B bpf_prog_test_run_syscall()   rcu_read_lock_trace()     bpf_prog_run_pin_on_cpu()       bpf_prog_load()         bpf_tracing_func_proto()           trace_set_clr_event()             mutex_lock(&event_mutex)  Delegate trace_set_clr_event() to workqueue to avoid such lock dependency.",
