  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftruncate: pass a signed offset  The old ftruncate() syscall, using the 32-bit off_t misses a sign extension when called in compat mode on 64-bit architectures.  As a result, passing a negative length accidentally succeeds in truncating to file size between 2GiB and 4GiB.  Changing the type of the compat syscall to the signed compat_off_t changes the behavior so it instead returns -EINVAL.  The native entry point, the truncate() syscall and the corresponding loff_t based variants are all correct already and do not suffer from this mistake.",
