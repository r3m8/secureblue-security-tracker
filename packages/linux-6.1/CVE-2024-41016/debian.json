  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()  xattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space requested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before memcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous images.",
