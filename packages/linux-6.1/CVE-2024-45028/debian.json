  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: mmc_test: Fix NULL dereference on allocation failure  If the \"test->highmem = alloc_pages()\" allocation fails then calling __free_pages(test->highmem) will result in a NULL dereference.  Also change the error code to -ENOMEM instead of returning success.",
