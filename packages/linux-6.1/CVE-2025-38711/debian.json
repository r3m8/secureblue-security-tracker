  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists  If smb2_create_link() is called with ReplaceIfExists set and the name does exist then a deadlock will happen.  ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_locked() will return with success and the parent directory will be locked.  ksmbd_vfs_remove_file() will then remove the file.  ksmbd_vfs_link() will then be called while the parent is still locked.  It will try to lock the same parent and will deadlock.  This patch moves the ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_unlock() call to *before* ksmbd_vfs_link() and then simplifies the code, removing the file_present flag variable.",
