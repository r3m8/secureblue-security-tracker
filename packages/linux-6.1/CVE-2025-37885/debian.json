  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postable  Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the *new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.  The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free, e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.",
