  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug  When the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the pnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges' hotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.  Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().  Also modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so that it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of pnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will now be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the workqueue needs to stay allocated.  The abridged kernel panic that occurs without this patch is as follows:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 687 at kernel/irq/msi.c:292 msi_device_data_release+0x6c/0x9c   CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 687 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.14.0-rc5+ #2   Call Trace:    msi_device_data_release+0x34/0x9c (unreliable)    release_nodes+0x64/0x13c    devres_release_all+0xc0/0x140    device_del+0x2d4/0x46c    pci_destroy_dev+0x5c/0x194    pci_hp_remove_devices+0x90/0x128    pci_hp_remove_devices+0x44/0x128    pnv_php_disable_slot+0x54/0xd4    power_write_file+0xf8/0x18c    pci_slot_attr_store+0x40/0x5c    sysfs_kf_write+0x64/0x78    kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x1b0/0x290    vfs_write+0x3bc/0x50c    ksys_write+0x84/0x140    system_call_exception+0x124/0x230    system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec  [bhelgaas: tidy comments]",
