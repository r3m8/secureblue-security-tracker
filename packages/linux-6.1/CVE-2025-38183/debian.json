  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: lan743x: fix potential out-of-bounds write in lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get()  Before calling lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(), the 'channel' value is checked against the maximum value of PCI11X1X_PTP_IO_MAX_CHANNELS(8). This seems correct and aligns with the PTP interrupt status register (PTP_INT_STS) specifications.  However, lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get() writes to ptp->extts[] with only LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS(4) elements, using channel as an index:      lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(..., u8 channel,...)     {         ...         /* Update Local timestamp */         extts = &ptp->extts[channel];         extts->ts.tv_sec = sec;         ...     }  To avoid an out-of-bounds write and utilize all the supported GPIO inputs, set LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS to 8.  Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.",
