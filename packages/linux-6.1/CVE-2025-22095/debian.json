  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()  If the regulator_bulk_get() returns an error and no regulators are created, we need to set their number to zero.  If we don't do this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the regulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel panic.  While at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error upwards as the kernel will WARN() on an error from add_bus().
