  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: fix mddev uaf while iterating all_mddevs list  While iterating all_mddevs list from md_notify_reboot() and md_exit(), list_for_each_entry_safe is used, and this can race with deletint the next mddev, causing UAF:  t1: spin_lock //list_for_each_entry_safe(mddev, n, ...)  mddev_get(mddev1)  // assume mddev2 is the next entry  spin_unlock             t2:             //remove mddev2             ...             mddev_free             spin_lock             list_del             spin_unlock             kfree(mddev2)  mddev_put(mddev1)  spin_lock  //continue dereference mddev2->all_mddevs  The old helper for_each_mddev() actually grab the reference of mddev2 while holding the lock, to prevent from being freed. This problem can be fixed the same way, however, the code will be complex.  Hence switch to use list_for_each_entry, in this case mddev_put() can free the mddev1 and it's not safe as well. Refer to md_seq_show(), also factor out a helper mddev_put_locked() to fix this problem.",
