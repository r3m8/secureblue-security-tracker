  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memcg: fix soft lockup in the OOM process  A soft lockup issue was found in the product with about 56,000 tasks were in the OOM cgroup, it was traversing them when the soft lockup was triggered.  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 23s!

As a result, this lead to soft lockup in the OOM process.  To fix this issue, call 'cond_resched' in the 'mem_cgroup_scan_tasks' function per 1000 iterations.  For global OOM, call 'touch_softlockup_watchdog' per 1000 iterations to avoid this issue.",
