  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: dell-wmi-sysman: Avoid buffer overflow in current_password_store()  If the 'buf' array received from the user contains an empty string, the 'length' variable will be zero. Accessing the 'buf' array element with index 'length - 1' will result in a buffer overflow.  Add a check for an empty string.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
