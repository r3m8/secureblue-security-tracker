  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Add a per-VF limit on number of FDIR filters  While the iavf driver adds a s/w limit (128) on the number of FDIR filters that the VF can request, a malicious VF driver can request more than that and exhaust the resources for other VFs.  Add a similar limit in ice.",
