  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Check validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo()  If a newly-added link type doesn't invoke BPF_LINK_TYPE(), accessing bpf_link_type_strs[link->type] may result in an out-of-bounds access.  To spot such missed invocations early in the future, checking the validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo() and emitting a warning when such invocations are missed.",
