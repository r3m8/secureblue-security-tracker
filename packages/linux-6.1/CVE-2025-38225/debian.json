  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imx-jpeg: Cleanup after an allocation error  When allocation failures are not cleaned up by the driver, further allocation errors will be false-positives, which will cause buffers to remain uninitialized and cause NULL pointer dereferences. Ensure proper cleanup of failed allocations to prevent these issues.",
