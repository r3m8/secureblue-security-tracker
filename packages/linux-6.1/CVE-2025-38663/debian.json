  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: reject invalid file types when reading inodes  To prevent inodes with invalid file types from tripping through the vfs and causing malfunctions or assertion failures, add a missing sanity check when reading an inode from a block device.  If the file type is not valid, treat it as a filesystem error.",
