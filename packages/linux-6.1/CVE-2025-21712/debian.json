  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/md-bitmap: Synchronize bitmap_get_stats() with bitmap lifetime  After commit ec6bb299c7c3 (\"md/md-bitmap: add 'sync_size' into struct md_bitmap_stats\"), following panic is reported:  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address RIP: 0010:bitmap_get_stats+0x2b/0xa0 Call Trace:  <TASK>  md_seq_show+0x2d2/0x5b0  seq_read_iter+0x2b9/0x470  seq_read+0x12f/0x180  proc_reg_read+0x57/0xb0  vfs_read+0xf6/0x380  ksys_read+0x6c/0xf0  do_syscall_64+0x82/0x170  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  Root cause is that bitmap_get_stats() can be called at anytime if mddev is still there, even if bitmap is destroyed, or not fully initialized. Deferenceing bitmap in this case can crash the kernel. Meanwhile, the above commit start to deferencing bitmap->storage, make the problem easier to trigger.  Fix the problem by protecting bitmap_get_stats() with bitmap_info.mutex.",
