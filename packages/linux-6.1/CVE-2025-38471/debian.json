  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: always refresh the queue when reading sock  After recent changes in net-next TCP compacts skbs much more aggressively. This unearthed a bug in TLS where we may try to operate on an old skb when checking if all skbs in the queue have matching decrypt state and geometry.      BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in tls_strp_check_rcv+0x898/0x9a0 [tls]     (net/tls/tls_strp.c:436 net/tls/tls_strp.c:530 net/tls/tls_strp.c:544)     Read of size 4 at addr ffff888013085750 by task tls/13529      CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 13529 Comm: tls Not tainted 6.16.0-rc5-virtme     Call Trace:      kasan_report+0xca/0x100      tls_strp_check_rcv+0x898/0x9a0 [tls]      tls_rx_rec_wait+0x2c9/0x8d0 [tls]      tls_sw_recvmsg+0x40f/0x1aa0 [tls]      inet_recvmsg+0x1c3/0x1f0  Always reload the queue, fast path is to have the record in the queue when we wake, anyway (IOW the path going down \"if !strp->stm.full_len\").",
