  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: davicom: fix UAF in dm9000_drv_remove  dm is netdev private data and it cannot be used after free_netdev() call. Using dm after free_netdev() can cause UAF bug. Fix it by moving free_netdev() at the end of the function.  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit ad297cd2db89 (\"net: qcom/emac: fix UAF in emac_remove\").  This bug is detected by our static analysis tool.",
