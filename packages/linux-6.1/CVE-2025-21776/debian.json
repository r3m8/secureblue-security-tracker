  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: hub: Ignore non-compliant devices with too many configs or interfaces  Robert Morris created a test program which can cause usb_hub_to_struct_hub() to dereference a NULL or inappropriate pointer:  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xcccccccccccccccc: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC PTI CPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 117 Comm: kworker/7:1 Not tainted 6.13.0-rc3-00017-gf44d154d6e3d #14 Hardware name: FreeBSD BHYVE/BHYVE, BIOS 14.0 10/17/2021 Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event RIP: 0010:usb_hub_adjust_deviceremovable+0x78/0x110 ...

We can prevent the problem from occurring by refusing to accept hub devices that violate the USB spec by having more than one configuration or interface.",
