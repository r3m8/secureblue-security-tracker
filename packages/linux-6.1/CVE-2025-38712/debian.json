  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hfsplus: don't use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()  When the volume header contains erroneous values that do not reflect the actual state of the filesystem, hfsplus_fill_super() assumes that the attributes file is not yet created, which later results in hitting BUG_ON() when hfsplus_create_attributes_file() is called. Replace this BUG_ON() with -EIO error with a message to suggest running fsck tool.",
