  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Check for hdwq null ptr when cleaning up lpfc_vport structure  If a call to lpfc_sli4_read_rev() from lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails, the resultant cleanup routine lpfc_sli4_vport_delete_fcp_xri_aborted() may occur before sli4_hba.hdwqs are allocated.  This may result in a null pointer dereference when attempting to take the abts_io_buf_list_lock for the first hardware queue.  Fix by adding a null ptr check on phba->sli4_hba.hdwq and early return because this situation means there must have been an error during port initialization.",
