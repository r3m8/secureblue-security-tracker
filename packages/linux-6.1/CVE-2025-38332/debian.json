  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version  The strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it thinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target buffer size is passed in.  Anyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just use memcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.  BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a properly terminated string.",
