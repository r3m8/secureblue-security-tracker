  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: xilinx_uartps: split sysrq handling  lockdep detects the following circular locking dependency:  CPU 0                      CPU 1 ========================== ============================ cdns_uart_isr()            printk()   uart_port_lock(port)       console_lock() \t\t\t     cdns_uart_console_write()                                if (!port->sysrq)                                  uart_port_lock(port)   uart_handle_break()     port->sysrq = ...   uart_handle_sysrq_char()     printk()       console_lock()  The fixed commit attempts to avoid this situation by only taking the port lock in cdns_uart_console_write if port->sysrq unset. However, if (as shown above) cdns_uart_console_write runs before port->sysrq is set, then it will try to take the port lock anyway. This may result in a deadlock.  Fix this by splitting sysrq handling into two parts. We use the prepare helper under the port lock and defer handling until we release the lock.",
