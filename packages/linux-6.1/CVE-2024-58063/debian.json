  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtlwifi: fix memory leaks and invalid access at probe error path  Deinitialize at reverse order when probe fails.  When init_sw_vars fails, rtl_deinit_core should not be called, specially now that it destroys the rtl_wq workqueue.  And call rtl_pci_deinit and deinit_sw_vars, otherwise, memory will be leaked.  Remove pci_set_drvdata call as it will already be cleaned up by the core driver code and could lead to memory leaks too. cf. commit 8d450935ae7f (\"wireless: rtlwifi: remove unnecessary pci_set_drvdata()\") and commit 3d86b93064c7 (\"rtlwifi: Fix PCI probe error path orphaned memory\").",
