  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix oops due to non-existence of prealloc backlog struct  If an AF_RXRPC service socket is opened and bound, but calls are preallocated, then rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() will oops because the rxrpc_backlog struct doesn't get allocated until the first preallocation is made.  Fix this by returning NULL from rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() if there is no backlog struct.  This will cause the incoming call to be aborted.",
