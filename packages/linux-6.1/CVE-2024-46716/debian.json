  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: altera-msgdma: properly free descriptor in msgdma_free_descriptor  Remove list_del call in msgdma_chan_desc_cleanup, this should be the role of msgdma_free_descriptor. In consequence replace list_add_tail with list_move_tail in msgdma_free_descriptor.  This fixes the path:    msgdma_free_chan_resources -> msgdma_free_descriptors ->    msgdma_free_desc_list -> msgdma_free_descriptor  which does not correctly free the descriptors as first nodes were not removed from the list.",
