  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Fix a fence leak in submit error path  In error paths, we could unref the submit without calling drm_sched_entity_push_job(), so msm_job_free() will never get called.  Since drm_sched_job_cleanup() will NULL out the s_fence, we can use that to detect this case.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/653584/",
