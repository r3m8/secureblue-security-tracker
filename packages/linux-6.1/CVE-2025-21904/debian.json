  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  caif_virtio: fix wrong pointer check in cfv_probe()  del_vqs() frees virtqueues, therefore cfv->vq_tx pointer should be checked for NULL before calling it, not cfv->vdev. Also the current implementation is redundant because the pointer cfv->vdev is dereferenced before it is checked for NULL.  Fix this by checking cfv->vq_tx for NULL instead of cfv->vdev before calling del_vqs().",
