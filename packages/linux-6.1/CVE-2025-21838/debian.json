  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after device removal  device_del() can lead to new work being scheduled in gadget->work workqueue. This is observed, for example, with the dwc3 driver with the following call stack:   device_del()     gadget_unbind_driver()       usb_gadget_disconnect_locked()         dwc3_gadget_pullup() \t  dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect() \t    usb_gadget_set_state() \t      schedule_work(&gadget->work)  Move flush_work() after device_del() to ensure the workqueue is cleaned up.",
