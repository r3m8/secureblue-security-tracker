  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/hns: Fix Use-After-Free of rsv_qp on HIP08  Currently rsv_qp is freed before ib_unregister_device() is called on HIP08. During the time interval, users can still dereg MR and rsv_qp will be used in this process, leading to a UAF. Move the release of rsv_qp after calling ib_unregister_device() to fix it.",
