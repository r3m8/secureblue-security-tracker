  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: uclogic: Add NULL check in uclogic_input_configured()  devm_kasprintf() returns NULL when memory allocation fails. Currently, uclogic_input_configured() does not check for this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  Add NULL check after devm_kasprintf() to prevent this issue.",
