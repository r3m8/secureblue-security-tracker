  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vkms: Fix use after free and double free on init error  If the driver initialization fails, the vkms_exit() function might access an uninitialized or freed default_config pointer and it might double free it.  Fix both possible errors by initializing default_config only when the driver initialization succeeded.",
