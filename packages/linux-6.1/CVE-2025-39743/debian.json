  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: truncate good inode pages when hard link is 0  The fileset value of the inode copy from the disk by the reproducer is AGGR_RESERVED_I. When executing evict, its hard link number is 0, so its inode pages are not truncated. This causes the bugon to be triggered when executing clear_inode() because nrpages is greater than 0.",
