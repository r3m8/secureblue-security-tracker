  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: ets: fix a race in ets_qdisc_change()  Gerrard Tai reported a race condition in ETS, whenever SFQ perturb timer fires at the wrong time.  The race is as follows:  CPU 0                                 CPU 1 [1]: lock root [2]: qdisc_tree_flush_backlog() [3]: unlock root  |  |                                    [5]: lock root  |                                    [6]: rehash  |                                    [7]: qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()  | [4]: qdisc_put()  This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen.  Calling qdisc_purge_queue() instead of qdisc_tree_flush_backlog() should fix the race, because all packets will be purged from the qdisc before releasing the lock.",
