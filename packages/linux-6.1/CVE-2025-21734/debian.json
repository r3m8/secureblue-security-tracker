  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Fix copy buffer page size  For non-registered buffer, fastrpc driver copies the buffer and pass it to the remote subsystem. There is a problem with current implementation of page size calculation which is not considering the offset in the calculation. This might lead to passing of improper and out-of-bounds page size which could result in memory issue. Calculate page start and page end using the offset adjusted address instead of absolute address.",
