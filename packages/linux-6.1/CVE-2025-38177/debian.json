  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent  hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:  1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is non-zero before calling it.  2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use    RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.",
