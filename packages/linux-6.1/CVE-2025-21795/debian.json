  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: fix hang in nfsd4_shutdown_callback  If nfs4_client is in courtesy state then there is no point to send the callback. This causes nfsd4_shutdown_callback to hang since cl_cb_inflight is not 0. This hang lasts about 15 minutes until TCP notifies NFSD that the connection was dropped.  This patch modifies nfsd4_run_cb_work to skip the RPC call if nfs4_client is in courtesy state.",
