  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_path  ppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:  1. The ppp->channels list can change between list_empty() and    list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel    is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may    access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.  2. pch->chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,    pch->chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp->channels.  Fix these by using a lockless RCU approach: - Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list   entry. - Convert list modifications on ppp->channels to their RCU variants and   add synchronize_net() after removal. - Check for a NULL pch->chan before dereferencing it.",
