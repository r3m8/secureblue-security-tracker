  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: af_can: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in can_create()  On error can_create() frees the allocated sk object, but sock_init_data() has already attached it to the provided sock object. This will leave a dangling sk pointer in the sock object and may cause use-after-free later.",
