  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Send signals asynchronously if !preemptible  BPF programs can execute in all kinds of contexts and when a program running in a non-preemptible context uses the bpf_send_signal() kfunc, it will cause issues because this kfunc can sleep. Change `irqs_disabled()` to `!preemptible()`.",
