  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: avoid possible overflow for chunk_sectors check in blk_stack_limits()  In blk_stack_limits(), we check that the t->chunk_sectors value is a multiple of the t->physical_block_size value.  However, by finding the chunk_sectors value in bytes, we may overflow the unsigned int which holds chunk_sectors, so change the check to be based on sectors.",
