  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: ctucanfd: handle skb allocation failure  If skb allocation fails, the pointer to struct can_frame is NULL. This is actually handled everywhere inside ctucan_err_interrupt() except for the only place.  Add the missed NULL check.
