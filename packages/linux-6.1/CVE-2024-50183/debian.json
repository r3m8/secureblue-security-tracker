  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Ensure DA_ID handling completion before deleting an NPIV instance  Deleting an NPIV instance requires all fabric ndlps to be released before an NPIV's resources can be torn down.  Failure to release fabric ndlps beforehand opens kref imbalance race conditions.  Fix by forcing the DA_ID to complete synchronously with usage of wait_queue.",
