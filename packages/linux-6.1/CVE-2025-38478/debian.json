  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice  Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access instruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this, but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes that write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are copied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left uninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first `MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction handlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For `do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for handling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the subdevice.",
