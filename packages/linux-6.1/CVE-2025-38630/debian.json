  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: imxfb: Check fb_add_videomode to prevent null-ptr-deref  fb_add_videomode() can fail with -ENOMEM when its internal kmalloc() cannot allocate a struct fb_modelist.  If that happens, the modelist stays empty but the driver continues to register.  Add a check for its return value to prevent poteintial null-ptr-deref, which is similar to the commit 17186f1f90d3 (\"fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var\").",
