  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: usbhid: Eliminate recurrent out-of-bounds bug in usbhid_parse()  Update struct hid_descriptor to better reflect the mandatory and optional parts of the HID Descriptor as per USB HID 1.11 specification. Note: the kernel currently does not parse any optional HID class descriptors, only the mandatory report descriptor.  Update all references to member element desc[0] to rpt_desc.  Add test to verify bLength and bNumDescriptors values are valid.  Replace the for loop with direct access to the mandatory HID class descriptor member for the report descriptor. This eliminates the possibility of getting an out-of-bounds fault.  Add a warning message if the HID descriptor contains any unsupported optional HID class descriptors.",
