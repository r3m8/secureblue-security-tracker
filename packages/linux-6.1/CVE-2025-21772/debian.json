  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  partitions: mac: fix handling of bogus partition table  Fix several issues in partition probing:   - The bailout for a bad partoffset must use put_dev_sector(), since the    preceding read_part_sector() succeeded.  - If the partition table claims a silly sector size like 0xfff bytes    (which results in partition table entries straddling sector boundaries),    bail out instead of accessing out-of-bounds memory.  - We must not assume that the partition table contains proper NUL    termination - use strnlen() and strncmp() instead of strlen() and    strcmp().",
