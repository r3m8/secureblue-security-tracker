  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid1: Fix stack memory use after return in raid1_reshape  In the raid1_reshape function, newpool is allocated on the stack and assigned to conf->r1bio_pool. This results in conf->r1bio_pool.wait.head pointing to a stack address. Accessing this address later can lead to a kernel panic.  Example access path:  raid1_reshape() { \t// newpool is on the stack \tmempool_t newpool, oldpool; \t// initialize newpool.wait.head to stack address \tmempool_init(&newpool, ...); \tconf->r1bio_pool = newpool; }  raid1_read_request() or raid1_write_request() { \talloc_r1bio() \t{ \t\tmempool_alloc() \t\t{ \t\t\t// if pool->alloc fails \t\t\tremove_element() \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t--pool->curr_nr; \t\t\t} \t\t} \t} }  mempool_free() { \tif (pool->curr_nr < pool->min_nr) { \t\t// pool->wait.head is a stack address \t\t// wake_up() will try to access this invalid address \t\t// which leads to a kernel panic \t\treturn; \t\twake_up(&pool->wait); \t} }  Fix: reinit conf->r1bio_pool.wait after assigning newpool.",
