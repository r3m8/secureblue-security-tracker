  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref when journal load failed.  During the mounting process, if journal_reset() fails because of too short journal, then lead to jbd2_journal_load() fails with NULL j_sb_buffer.  Subsequently, ocfs2_journal_shutdown() calls jbd2_journal_flush()->jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()-> __jbd2_update_log_tail()->jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail() ->lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer), resulting in a null-pointer dereference error.  To resolve this issue, we should check the JBD2_LOADED flag to ensure the journal was properly loaded.  Additionally, use journal instead of osb->journal directly to simplify the code.",
