  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: inet: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in inet_create()  sock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk object to the provided sock object. If inet_create() fails later, the sk object is freed, but the sock object retains the dangling pointer, which may create use-after-free later.  Clear the sk pointer in the sock object on error.",
