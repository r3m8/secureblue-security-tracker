  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/cpu/hygon: Add missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in bsp_init helper  Since    923f3a2b48bd (\"x86/resctrl: Query LLC monitoring properties once during boot\")  resctrl_cpu_detect() has been moved from common CPU initialization code to the vendor-specific BSP init helper, while Hygon didn't put that call in their code.  This triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on our machines with X86_FEATURE_CQM* supported, where get_rdt_mon_resources() tries to calculate mon_l3_config with uninitialized boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_occ_scale.  Add the missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in the Hygon BSP init helper.    [ bp: Massage commit message. ]",
