  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: gadget: f_midi: f_midi_complete to call queue_work  When using USB MIDI, a lock is attempted to be acquired twice through a re-entrant call to f_midi_transmit, causing a deadlock.  Fix it by using queue_work() to schedule the inner f_midi_transmit() via a high priority work queue from the completion handler.",
