  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pcmcia: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in __iodyn_find_io_region()  In __iodyn_find_io_region(), pcmcia_make_resource() is assigned to res and used in pci_bus_alloc_resource(). There is a dereference of res in pci_bus_alloc_resource(), which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of pcmcia_make_resource().  Fix this bug by adding a check of res.",
