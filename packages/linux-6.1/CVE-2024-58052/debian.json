  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atomctrl_get_smc_sclk_range_table  The function atomctrl_get_smc_sclk_range_table() does not check the return value of smu_atom_get_data_table(). If smu_atom_get_data_table() fails to retrieve SMU_Info table, it returns NULL which is later dereferenced.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.  In practice this should never happen as this code only gets called on polaris chips and the vbios data table will always be present on those chips.",
