  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  maple_tree: fix MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag in mas_preallocate()  Temporarily clear the preallocation flag when explicitly requesting allocations.  Pre-existing allocations are already counted against the request through mas_node_count_gfp(), but the allocations will not happen if the MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag is set.  This flag is meant to avoid re-allocating in bulk allocation mode, and to detect issues with preallocation calculations.  The MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag should also always be set on zero allocations so that detection of underflow allocations will print a WARN_ON() during consumption.  User visible effect of this flaw is a WARN_ON() followed by a null pointer dereference when subsequent requests for larger number of nodes is ignored, such as the vma merge retry in mmap_region() caused by drivers altering the vma flags (which happens in v6.6, at least)",
