  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly  Patch series \"Convert ocfs2 to use folios\".  Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a giant patch for review ;-)  So I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches where his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it; his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our bugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the changes I made to his code!   This patch (of 23):  If we can't read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page before returning.",
