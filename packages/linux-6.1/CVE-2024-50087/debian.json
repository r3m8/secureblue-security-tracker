  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free on read_alloc_one_name() error  The function read_alloc_one_name() does not initialize the name field of the passed fscrypt_str struct if kmalloc fails to allocate the corresponding buffer.  Thus, it is not guaranteed that fscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it.  This is a follow-up to the linked patch that fixes the remaining instances of the bug introduced by commit e43eec81c516 (\"btrfs: use struct qstr instead of name and namelen pairs\").",
