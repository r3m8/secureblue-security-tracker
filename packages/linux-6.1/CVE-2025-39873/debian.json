  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB  can_put_echo_skb() takes ownership of the SKB and it may be freed during or after the call.  However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call.  Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done touching the SKB.  The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not matter.  An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 (\"can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb memory\") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.  [mkl: add \"commit\" in front of sha1 in patch description] [mkl: fix indention]",
