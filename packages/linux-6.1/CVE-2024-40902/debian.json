  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: xattr: fix buffer overflow for invalid xattr  When an xattr size is not what is expected, it is printed out to the kernel log in hex format as a form of debugging.  But when that xattr size is bigger than the expected size, printing it out can cause an access off the end of the buffer.  Fix this all up by properly restricting the size of the debug hex dump in the kernel log.",
