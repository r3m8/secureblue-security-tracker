  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget  The cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit 58f2fcb3a845 (\"usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget\").  Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using \"iperf --bidir\" over NCM ethernet link.  The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.",
