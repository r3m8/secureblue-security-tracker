  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon: add vblank check in IRQ handling  If there's support for another console device (such as a TTY serial), the kernel occasionally panics during boot. The panic message and a relevant snippet of the call stack is as follows:    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000000   Call trace:     drm_crtc_handle_vblank+0x10/0x30 (P)     decon_irq_handler+0x88/0xb4     [...]  Otherwise, the panics don't happen. This indicates that it's some sort of race condition.  Add a check to validate if the drm device can handle vblanks before calling drm_crtc_handle_vblank() to avoid this.",
