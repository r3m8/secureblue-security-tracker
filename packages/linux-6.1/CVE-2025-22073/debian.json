  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spufs: fix a leak on spufs_new_file() failure  It's called from spufs_fill_dir(), and caller of that will do spufs_rmdir() in case of failure.  That does remove everything we'd managed to create, but... the problem dentry is still negative.  IOW, it needs to be explicitly dropped.",
