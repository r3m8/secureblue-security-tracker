  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  batman-adv: fix OOB read/write in network-coding decode  batadv_nc_skb_decode_packet() trusts coded_len and checks only against skb->len. XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducing payload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing an out-of-bounds read and a small out-of-bounds write.  Validate that coded_len fits within the payload area of both destination and source sk_buffs before XORing.",
