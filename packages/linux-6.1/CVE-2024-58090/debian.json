  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled  David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:    Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220    kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180    __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250    do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180  The corresponding interrupt flag trace:    hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90   hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90  That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:    __cond_resched+0x21/0x60   down_timeout+0x18/0x60   acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80   acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100   acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60   acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0   acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190   acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290   irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60   syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200   kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0   __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180  This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above warning at the end.  Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations it's just a question of time.  The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into account.  Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().",
