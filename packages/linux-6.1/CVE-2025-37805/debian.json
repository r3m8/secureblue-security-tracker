  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sound/virtio: Fix cancel_sync warnings on uninitialized work_structs  Betty reported hitting the following warning:  [    8.709131][  T221] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 221 at kernel/workqueue.c:4182 ...

It seems we're hitting the error path in virtsnd_probe(), which triggers a virtsnd_remove() which iterates over the substreams calling cancel_work_sync() on the elapsed_period work_struct.  Looking at the code, from earlier in: virtsnd_probe()->virtsnd_build_devs()->virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg()  We set snd->nsubstreams, allocate the snd->substreams, and if we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having initialized the elapsed_period work_struct.  When that error path unwinds we then call virtsnd_remove() which as long as the substreams array is allocated, will iterate through calling cancel_work_sync() on the uninitialized work struct hitting this warning.  Takashi Iwai suggested this fix, which initializes the substreams structure right after allocation, so that if we hit the error paths we avoid trying to cleanup uninitialized data.  Note: I have not yet managed to reproduce the issue myself, so this patch has had limited testing.  Feedback or thoughts would be appreciated!",
