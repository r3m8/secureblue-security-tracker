  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb_strndup_from_utf16()  If ->NameOffset of smb2_create_req is smaller than Buffer offset of smb2_create_req, slab-out-of-bounds read can happen from smb2_open. This patch set the minimum value of the name offset to the buffer offset to validate name length of smb2_create_req().",
