  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: aspeed: Add NULL check in aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop()  devm_kasprintf() returns NULL when memory allocation fails. Currently, aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop() does not check for this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  Add NULL check after devm_kasprintf() to prevent this issue.
