  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qedf: Fix a possible memory leak in qedf_alloc_and_init_sb()  Hook \"qed_ops->common->sb_init = qed_sb_init\" does not release the DMA memory sb_virt when it fails. Add dma_free_coherent() to free it. This is the same way as qedr_alloc_mem_sb() and qede_alloc_mem_sb().",
