  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kasan: remove kasan_find_vm_area() to prevent possible deadlock  find_vm_area() couldn't be called in atomic_context.  If find_vm_area() is called to reports vm area information, kasan can trigger deadlock like:  CPU0                                CPU1 vmalloc();  alloc_vmap_area();   spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock)                                     spin_lock_bh(&some_lock);    <interrupt occurs>    <in softirq>    spin_lock(&some_lock);                                     <access invalid address>                                     kasan_report();                                      print_report();                                       print_address_description();                                        kasan_find_vm_area();                                         find_vm_area();                                          spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock) // deadlock!  To prevent possible deadlock while kasan reports, remove kasan_find_vm_area().",
