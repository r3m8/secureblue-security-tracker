  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA: hfi1: fix possible divide-by-zero in find_hw_thread_mask()  The function divides number of online CPUs by num_core_siblings, and later checks the divider by zero. This implies a possibility to get and divide-by-zero runtime error. Fix it by moving the check prior to division. This also helps to save one indentation level.",
