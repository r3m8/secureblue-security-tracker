  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite  In  riocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)    -> cm_chan_msg_send()       -> riocm_ch_send()  cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but riocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The result is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr which were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send() allocated.  Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire rio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.",
