  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps  The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:  |        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */ |        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME)) |                WARN_ON(1);  This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:    751ecf6afd6568ad (\"arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps\")  The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on the same CPU, e.g.  | void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs) | { |         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled |         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0. |         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task. | |         ... | |         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1. |         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set. | |         get_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | |         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */ |         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME)) |                 WARN_ON(1); | |         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) { |                 unsigned long vq_minus_one = |                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1; |                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one); | |                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu(); |         } | |         put_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | |         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0. |         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0 |         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then: |         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled) |         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared |         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore | }  Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.
