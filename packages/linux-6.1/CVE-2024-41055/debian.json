  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: prevent derefencing NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid()  Commit 5ec8e8ea8b77 (\"mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage\") changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE() call around \"ms->usage\" to fix a race with section_deactivate() where ms->usage can be cleared.  The READ_ONCE() call, by itself, is not enough to prevent NULL pointer dereference.  We need to check its value before dereferencing it.",
