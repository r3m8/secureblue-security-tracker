  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSv4/pNFS: Fix a race to wake on NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN  We found a few different systems hung up in writeback waiting on the same page lock, and one task waiting on the NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN bit in pnfs_update_layout(), however the pnfs_layout_hdr's plh_outstanding count was zero.  It seems most likely that this is another race between the waiter and waker similar to commit ed0172af5d6f (\"SUNRPC: Fix a race to wake a sync task\"). Fix it up by applying the advised barrier.",
