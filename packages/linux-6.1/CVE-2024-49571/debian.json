  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: check iparea_offset and ipv6_prefixes_cnt when receiving proposal msg  When receiving proposal msg in server, the field iparea_offset and the field ipv6_prefixes_cnt in proposal msg are from the remote client and can not be fully trusted. Especially the field iparea_offset, once exceed the max value, there has the chance to access wrong address, and crash may happen.  This patch checks iparea_offset and ipv6_prefixes_cnt before using them.",
