  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()  In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on rain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.  Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.  Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full check. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification are performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the lock.  This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool developed by our team.",
