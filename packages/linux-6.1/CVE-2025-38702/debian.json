  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: fix potential buffer overflow in do_register_framebuffer()  The current implementation may lead to buffer overflow when: 1.  Unregistration creates NULL gaps in registered_fb[] 2.  All array slots become occupied despite num_registered_fb < FB_MAX 3.  The registration loop exceeds array bounds  Add boundary check to prevent registered_fb[FB_MAX] access.",
