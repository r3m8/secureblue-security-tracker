  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio-net: ensure the received length does not exceed allocated size  In xdp_linearize_page, when reading the following buffers from the ring, we forget to check the received length with the true allocate size. This can lead to an out-of-bound read. This commit adds that missing check.",
