  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14  [WHY & HOW] A warning message \"WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397 calculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu]\" occurs because the display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is observed in Radeon RX 6600 XT.  It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.  Also fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.  (cherry picked from commit 274a87eb389f58eddcbc5659ab0b180b37e92775)",
