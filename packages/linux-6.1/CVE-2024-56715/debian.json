  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ionic: Fix netdev notifier unregister on failure  If register_netdev() fails, then the driver leaks the netdev notifier. Fix this by calling ionic_lif_unregister() on register_netdev() failure. This will also call ionic_lif_unregister_phc() if it has already been registered.",
