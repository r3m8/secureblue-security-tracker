  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/skx_common: Fix general protection fault  After loading i10nm_edac (which automatically loads skx_edac_common), if unload only i10nm_edac, then reload it and perform error injection testing, a general protection fault may occur:    mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check events logged   Oops: general protection fault ...   ...   Workqueue: events mce_gen_pool_process   RIP: 0010:string+0x53/0xe0   ...   Call Trace:   <TASK>   ? die_addr+0x37/0x90   ? exc_general_protection+0x1e7/0x3f0   ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x26/0x30   ? string+0x53/0xe0   vsnprintf+0x23e/0x4c0   snprintf+0x4d/0x70   skx_adxl_decode+0x16a/0x330 [skx_edac_common]   skx_mce_check_error.part.0+0xf8/0x220 [skx_edac_common]   skx_mce_check_error+0x17/0x20 [skx_edac_common]   ...  The issue arose was because the variable 'adxl_component_count' (inside skx_edac_common), which counts the ADXL components, was not reset. During the reloading of i10nm_edac, the count was incremented by the actual number of ADXL components again, resulting in a count that was double the real number of ADXL components. This led to an out-of-bounds reference to the ADXL component array, causing the general protection fault above.  Fix this issue by resetting the 'adxl_component_count' in adxl_put(), which is called during the unloading of {skx,i10nm}_edac.",
