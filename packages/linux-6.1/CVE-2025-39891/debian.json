  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mwifiex: Initialize the chan_stats array to zero  The adapter->chan_stats[] array is initialized in mwifiex_init_channel_scan_gap() with vmalloc(), which doesn't zero out memory.  The array is filled in mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() and then the user can query the data in mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey().  There are two potential issues here.  What if the user calls mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey() before the data has been filled in. Also the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn't necessarily initialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized at the start that could result in an information leak.  Also this array is pretty small.  It's a maximum of 900 bytes so it's more appropriate to use kcalloc() instead vmalloc().",
