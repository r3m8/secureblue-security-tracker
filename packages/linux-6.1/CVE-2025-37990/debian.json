  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()  The function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() calls the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The 'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized if the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to use uninitialized variables in the conditions.  Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to error handling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the 'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized.  Improve the error message to report more detailed error information.",
