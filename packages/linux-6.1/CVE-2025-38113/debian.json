  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: CPPC: Fix NULL pointer dereference when nosmp is used  With nosmp in cmdline, other CPUs are not brought up, leaving their cpc_desc_ptr NULL. CPU0's iteration via for_each_possible_cpu() dereferences these NULL pointers, causing panic.  Panic backtrace:  [    0.401123] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000b8 ... [    0.403255] [<ffffffff809a5818>] cppc_allow_fast_switch+0x6a/0xd4 ...
