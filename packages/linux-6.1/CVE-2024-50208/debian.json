  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix a bug while setting up Level-2 PBL pages  Avoid memory corruption while setting up Level-2 PBL pages for the non MR resources when num_pages > 256K.  There will be a single PDE page address (contiguous pages in the case of > PAGE_SIZE), but, current logic assumes multiple pages, leading to invalid memory access after 256K PBL entries in the PDE.",
