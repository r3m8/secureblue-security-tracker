  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd/iova_bitmap: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()  Resolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index() where shifting the constant \"1\" (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift (an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior.  The constant \"1\" defaults to a 32-bit \"int\", and when \"pgshift\" exceeds 31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows, as the result cannot be represented in a 32-bit type.  To resolve this, the constant is updated to \"1UL\", promoting it to an unsigned long type to match the operand's type.",
