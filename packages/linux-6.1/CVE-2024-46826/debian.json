  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ELF: fix kernel.randomize_va_space double read  ELF loader uses \"randomize_va_space\" twice. It is sysctl and can change at any moment, so 2 loads could see 2 different values in theory with unpredictable consequences.  Issue exactly one load for consistent value across one exec.",
