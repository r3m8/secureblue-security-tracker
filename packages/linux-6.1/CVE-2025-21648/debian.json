  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: conntrack: clamp maximum hashtable size to INT_MAX  Use INT_MAX as maximum size for the conntrack hashtable. Otherwise, it is possible to hit WARN_ON_ONCE in __kvmalloc_node_noprof() when resizing hashtable because __GFP_NOWARN is unset. See:    0708a0afe291 (\"mm: Consider __GFP_NOWARN flag for oversized kvmalloc() calls\")  Note: hashtable resize is only possible from init_netns.",
