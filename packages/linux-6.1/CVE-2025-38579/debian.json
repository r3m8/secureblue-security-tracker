  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage  KMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`  and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.  The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three fields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the remaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior when those fields are accessed later, especially during extent merging.  Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.",
