  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset  During reset, cmd to destroy resources such as qp, cq, and mr may fail, and error logs will be printed. When a large number of resources are destroyed, there will be lots of printings, and it may lead to a cpu stuck.  Delete some unnecessary printings and replace other printing functions in these paths with the ratelimited version.",
