  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation  The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 << l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined behavior and improper AG sizing.  On 32-bit architectures: - Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow - This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in sbi->bmap->db_agsize - Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures - Could lead to:   - Filesystem corruption during extend operations   - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses   - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures  Fix by casting to s64 before shifting: bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;  This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in JFS block calculation code.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
