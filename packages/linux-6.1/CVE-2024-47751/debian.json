  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: kirin: Fix buffer overflow in kirin_pcie_parse_port()  Within kirin_pcie_parse_port(), the pcie->num_slots is compared to pcie->gpio_id_reset size (MAX_PCI_SLOTS) which is correct and would lead to an overflow.  Thus, fix condition to pcie->num_slots + 1 >= MAX_PCI_SLOTS and move pcie->num_slots increment below the if-statement to avoid out-of-bounds array access.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.  [kwilczynski: commit log]",
