  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()  The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error handling is a bit subtle.  It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner way.  The issues here are:  1) If \"idxd->max_wqs\" is <= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when    \"conf_dev\" hasn't been initialized. 2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again \"conf_dev\" is invalid.  It's    either uninitialized or it points to the \"conf_dev\" from the    previous iteration so it leads to a double free.  It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations.  I also renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto was located.",
