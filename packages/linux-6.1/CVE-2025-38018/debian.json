  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/tls: fix kernel panic when alloc_page failed  We cannot set frag_list to NULL pointer when alloc_page failed. It will be used in tls_strp_check_queue_ok when the next time tls_strp_read_sock is called.  This is because we don't reset full_len in tls_strp_flush_anchor_copy() so the recv path will try to continue handling the partial record on the next call but we dettached the rcvq from the frag list. Alternative fix would be to reset full_len.  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000028  Call trace:  tls_strp_check_rcv+0x128/0x27c  tls_strp_data_ready+0x34/0x44  tls_data_ready+0x3c/0x1f0  tcp_data_ready+0x9c/0xe4  tcp_data_queue+0xf6c/0x12d0  tcp_rcv_established+0x52c/0x798",
