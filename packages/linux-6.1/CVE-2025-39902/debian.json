  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()  object_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such as the freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid, attempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it does not point to a valid object.  One known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks() determines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of a freelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it. The debug code should report and handle the corruption gracefully and not crash in the process.  In case the pointer is NULL or check_valid_pointer() returns false for the pointer, only print the pointer value and skip accessing metadata.",
