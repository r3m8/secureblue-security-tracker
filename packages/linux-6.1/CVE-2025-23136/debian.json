  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: int340x: Add NULL check for adev  Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL. This is similar to the commit cd2fd6eab480 (\"platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL\").  Add a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to avoid a possible NULL pointer deref in int3402_thermal_probe().  Note, under the same directory, int3400_thermal_probe() has such a check.  [ rjw: Subject edit, added Fixes: ]",
