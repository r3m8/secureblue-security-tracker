  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: qcom: gcc-sm6350: Add missing parent_map for two clocks  If a clk_rcg2 has a parent, it should also have parent_map defined, otherwise we'll get a NULL pointer dereference when calling clk_set_rate like the following:    [    3.388105] Call trace:   [    3.390664]  qcom_find_src_index+0x3c/0x70 (P)   [    3.395301]  qcom_find_src_index+0x1c/0x70 (L)   [    3.399934]  _freq_tbl_determine_rate+0x48/0x100   [    3.404753]  clk_rcg2_determine_rate+0x1c/0x28   [    3.409387]  clk_core_determine_round_nolock+0x58/0xe4   [    3.421414]  clk_core_round_rate_nolock+0x48/0xfc   [    3.432974]  clk_core_round_rate_nolock+0xd0/0xfc   [    3.444483]  clk_core_set_rate_nolock+0x8c/0x300   [    3.455886]  clk_set_rate+0x38/0x14c  Add the parent_map property for two clocks where it's missing and also un-inline the parent_data as well to keep the matching parent_map and parent_data together.",
