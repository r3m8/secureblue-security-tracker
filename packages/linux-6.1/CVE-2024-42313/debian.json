  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus: fix use after free in vdec_close  There appears to be a possible use after free with vdec_close(). The firmware will add buffer release work to the work queue through HFI callbacks as a normal part of decoding. Randomly closing the decoder device from userspace during normal decoding can incur a read after free for inst.  Fix it by cancelling the work in vdec_close.",
