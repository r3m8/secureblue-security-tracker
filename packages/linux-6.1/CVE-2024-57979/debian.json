Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops - BUG: Fatal exception  This happens because pps_device_destruct() frees the pps_device with the embedded cdev immediately after calling cdev_del(), but, as the comment above cdev_del() notes, fops for previously opened cdevs are still callable even after cdev_del() returns. I think this bug has always been there: I can't explain why it suddenly started happening every time I reboot this particular board.  In commit d953e0e837e6 (\"pps: Fix a use-after free bug when unregistering a source.\"), George Spelvin suggested removing the embedded cdev. That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've implemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr becoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which device.  But now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(), we need to be sure the pps->dev refcount can't reach zero while userspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to pps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps->dev.      pps_core: source serial1 got cdev (251:1)     <...>     pps pps1: removed     pps_core: unregistering pps1     pps_core: deallocating pps1",
