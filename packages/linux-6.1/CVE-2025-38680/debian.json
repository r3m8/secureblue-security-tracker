  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()  The buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured that the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen > 2), buf the function accesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.  This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.  Fix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in uvc_parse_format().",
