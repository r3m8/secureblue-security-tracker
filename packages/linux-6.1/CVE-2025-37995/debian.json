  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  module: ensure that kobject_put() is safe for module type kobjects  In 'lookup_or_create_module_kobject()', an internal kobject is created using 'module_ktype'. So call to 'kobject_put()' on error handling path causes an attempt to use an uninitialized completion pointer in 'module_kobject_release()'. In this scenario, we just want to release kobject without an extra synchronization required for a regular module unloading process, so adding an extra check whether 'complete()' is actually required makes 'kobject_put()' safe.",
