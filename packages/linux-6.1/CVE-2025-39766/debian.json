  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: Make cake_enqueue return NET_XMIT_CN when past buffer_limit  The following setup can trigger a WARNING in htb_activate due to the condition: !cl->leaf.q->q.qlen  tc qdisc del dev lo root tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1 tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 \\        htb rate 64bit tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle f: \\        cake memlimit 1b ping -I lo -f -c1 -s64 -W0.001 127.0.0.1  This is because the low memlimit leads to a low buffer_limit, which causes packet dropping. However, cake_enqueue still returns NET_XMIT_SUCCESS, causing htb_enqueue to call htb_activate with an empty child qdisc. We should return NET_XMIT_CN when packets are dropped from the same tin and flow.  I do not believe return value of NET_XMIT_CN is necessary for packet drops in the case of ack filtering, as that is meant to optimize performance, not to signal congestion.",
