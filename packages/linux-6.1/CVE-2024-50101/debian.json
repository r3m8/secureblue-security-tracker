  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices  Previously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called pci_for_each_dma_alias() to set up context entries for non-PCI devices. This could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.  Add a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For non-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.",
