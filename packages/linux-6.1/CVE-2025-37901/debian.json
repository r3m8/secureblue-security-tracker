  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/qcom-mpm: Prevent crash when trying to handle non-wake GPIOs  On Qualcomm chipsets not all GPIOs are wakeup capable. Those GPIOs do not have a corresponding MPM pin and should not be handled inside the MPM driver. The IRQ domain hierarchy is always applied, so it's required to explicitly disconnect the hierarchy for those. The pinctrl-msm driver marks these with GPIO_NO_WAKE_IRQ. qcom-pdc has a check for this, but irq-qcom-mpm is currently missing the check. This is causing crashes when setting up interrupts for non-wake GPIOs:   root@rb1:~# gpiomon -c gpiochip1 10    irq: IRQ159: trimming hierarchy from :soc@0:interrupt-controller@f200000-1    Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000a1dc3820    Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
