  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: prevent release journal inode after journal shutdown  Before calling ocfs2_delete_osb(), ocfs2_journal_shutdown() has already been executed in ocfs2_dismount_volume(), so osb->journal must be NULL.  Therefore, the following calltrace will inevitably fail when it reaches jbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode().  ocfs2_dismount_volume()->   ocfs2_delete_osb()->     ocfs2_free_slot_info()->       __ocfs2_free_slot_info()->         evict()->           ocfs2_evict_inode()->             ocfs2_clear_inode()-> \t      jbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode(osb->journal->j_journal,  Adding osb->journal checks will prevent null-ptr-deref during the above execution path.",
