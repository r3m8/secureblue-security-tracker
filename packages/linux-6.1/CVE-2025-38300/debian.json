  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: sun8i-ce-cipher - fix error handling in sun8i_ce_cipher_prepare()  Fix two DMA cleanup issues on the error path in sun8i_ce_cipher_prepare():  1] If dma_map_sg() fails for areq->dst, the device driver would try to free    DMA memory it has not allocated in the first place. To fix this, on the    \"theend_sgs\" error path, call dma unmap only if the corresponding dma    map was successful.  2] If the dma_map_single() call for the IV fails, the device driver would    try to free an invalid DMA memory address on the \"theend_iv\" path:    ------------[ cut here ]------------    DMA-API: sun8i-ce 1904000.crypto: device driver tries to free an invalid DMA memory address    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 69 at kernel/dma/debug.c:968 check_unmap+0x123c/0x1b90    Modules linked in: skcipher_example(O+)    CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 69 Comm: 1904000.crypto- Tainted: G           O        6.15.0-rc3+ #24 PREEMPT    Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE    Hardware name: OrangePi Zero2 (DT)    pc : check_unmap+0x123c/0x1b90    lr : check_unmap+0x123c/0x1b90    ...
