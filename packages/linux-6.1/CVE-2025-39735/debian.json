  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()  During the \"size_check\" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs \"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().  Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:  \tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));  Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads \"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).  The \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned type), this is then stored inside a variable called \"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump() the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is 18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer() on each iteration:  \tfor (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) { \t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize); \t\tremaining -= rowsize;  \t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize, \t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);  \t\t... \t}  The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to the \"ptr+i\" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer to the end of the actual bounds of \"ptr\", eventually an out of bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following for loop:  \tfor (j = 0; j < len; j++) { \t\t\tif (linebuflen < lx + 2) \t\t\t\tgoto overflow2; \t\t\tch = ptr[j]; \t\t... \t}  To fix this we should validate \"EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)\" before it is utilised.",
