  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus: protect against spurious interrupts during probe  Make sure the interrupt handler is initialized before the interrupt is registered.  If the IRQ is registered before hfi_create(), it's possible that an interrupt fires before the handler setup is complete, leading to a NULL dereference.
