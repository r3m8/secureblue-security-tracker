  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Reject %p% format string in bprintf-like helpers  static const char fmt[] = \"%p%\";     bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt));  The above BPF program isn't rejected and causes a kernel warning at runtime:      Please remove unsupported %\\x00 in format string     WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7244 at lib/vsprintf.c:2680 format_decode+0x49c/0x5d0  This happens because bpf_bprintf_prepare skips over the second %, detected as punctuation, while processing %p. This patch fixes it by not skipping over punctuation. %\\x00 is then processed in the next iteration and rejected.",
