  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart  In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read() utilises a local buffer called \"buff\", which is initialised with control_read(). However \"buff\" is conditionally initialised inside control_read():          if (err == size) {                 memcpy(data, buf, size);         }  If the condition of \"err == size\" is not met, then \"buff\" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the uninitialised \"buff\" is accessed and returned during ch9200_mdio_read():          return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);  The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read() ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to uinit-access of \"buff\".  To fix this we should check the return value of control_read() and return early on error.",
