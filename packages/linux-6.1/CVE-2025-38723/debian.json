  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall  The extra pass of bpf_int_jit_compile() skips JIT context initialization which essentially skips offset calculation leaving out_offset = -1, so the jmp_offset in emit_bpf_tail_call is calculated by  \"#define jmp_offset (out_offset - (cur_offset))\"  is a negative number, which is wrong. The final generated assembly are as follow.  54:\tbgeu        \t$a2, $t1, -8\t    # 0x0000004c 58:\taddi.d      \t$a6, $s5, -1 5c:\tbltz        \t$a6, -16\t    # 0x0000004c 60:\talsl.d      \t$t2, $a2, $a1, 0x3 64:\tld.d        \t$t2, $t2, 264 68:\tbeq         \t$t2, $zero, -28\t    # 0x0000004c  Before apply this patch, the follow test case will reveal soft lock issues.  cd tools/testing/selftests/bpf/ ./test_progs --allow=tailcalls/tailcall_bpf2bpf_1  dmesg: watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 26s!
