  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: davinci: Add NULL check in davinci_lpsc_clk_register()  devm_kasprintf() returns NULL when memory allocation fails. Currently, davinci_lpsc_clk_register() does not check for this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  Add NULL check after devm_kasprintf() to prevent this issue and ensuring no resources are left allocated.",
