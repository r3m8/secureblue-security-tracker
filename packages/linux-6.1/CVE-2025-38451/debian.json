  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/md-bitmap: fix GPF in bitmap_get_stats()  The commit message of commit 6ec1f0239485 (\"md/md-bitmap: fix stats collection for external bitmaps\") states:      Remove the external bitmap check as the statistics should be     available regardless of bitmap storage location.      Return -EINVAL only for invalid bitmap with no storage (neither in     superblock nor in external file).  But, the code does not adhere to the above, as it does only check for a valid super-block for \"internal\" bitmaps. Hence, we observe:  Oops: GPF, probably for non-canonical address 0x1cd66f1f40000028 RIP: 0010:bitmap_get_stats+0x45/0xd0 Call Trace:   seq_read_iter+0x2b9/0x46a  seq_read+0x12f/0x180  proc_reg_read+0x57/0xb0  vfs_read+0xf6/0x380  ksys_read+0x6d/0xf0  do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x1b0  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  We fix this by checking the existence of a super-block for both the internal and external case.",
