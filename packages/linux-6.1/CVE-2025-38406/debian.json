  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath6kl: remove WARN on bad firmware input  If the firmware gives bad input, that's nothing to do with the driver's stack at this point etc., so the WARN_ON() doesn't add any value. Additionally, this is one of the top syzbot reports now. Just print a message, and as an added bonus, print the sizes too.",
