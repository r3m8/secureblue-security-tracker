  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipmi:msghandler: Fix potential memory corruption in ipmi_create_user()  The \"intf\" list iterator is an invalid pointer if the correct \"intf->intf_num\" is not found.  Calling atomic_dec(&intf->nr_users) on and invalid pointer will lead to memory corruption.  We don't really need to call atomic_dec() if we haven't called atomic_add_return() so update the if (intf->in_shutdown) path as well.",
