  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  IORING_OP_READ did not correctly consume the provided buffer list when read i/o returned < 0 (except for -EAGAIN and -EIOCBQUEUED return). This can lead to a potential use-after-free when the completion via io_rw_done runs at separate context.",
