  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: das16m1: Fix bit shift out of bounds  When checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:  \t/* only irqs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are valid */ \tif ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {  However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with the original test.",
