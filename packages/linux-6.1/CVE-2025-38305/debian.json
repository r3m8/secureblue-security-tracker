  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptp: remove ptp->n_vclocks check logic in ptp_vclock_in_use()  There is no disagreement that we should check both ptp->is_virtual_clock and ptp->n_vclocks to check if the ptp virtual clock is in use.  However, when we acquire ptp->n_vclocks_mux to read ptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use(), we observe a recursive lock in the call trace starting from n_vclocks_store().  ============================================ WARNING: possible recursive locking detected 6.15.0-rc6 #1 Not tainted -------------------------------------------- syz.0.1540/13807 is trying to acquire lock: ffff888035a24868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:  ptp_vclock_in_use drivers/ptp/ptp_private.h:103 [inline] ffff888035a24868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:  ptp_clock_unregister+0x21/0x250 drivers/ptp/ptp_clock.c:415  but task is already holding lock: ffff888030704868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:  n_vclocks_store+0xf1/0x6d0 drivers/ptp/ptp_sysfs.c:215  other info that might help us debug this:  Possible unsafe locking scenario:         CPU0        ----   lock(&ptp->n_vclocks_mux);   lock(&ptp->n_vclocks_mux);   *** DEADLOCK *** .... ============================================  The best way to solve this is to remove the logic that checks ptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use().  The reason why this is appropriate is that any path that uses ptp->n_vclocks must unconditionally check if ptp->n_vclocks is greater than 0 before unregistering vclocks, and all functions are already written this way. And in the function that uses ptp->n_vclocks, we already get ptp->n_vclocks_mux before unregistering vclocks.  Therefore, we need to remove the redundant check for ptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use() to prevent recursive locking.",
