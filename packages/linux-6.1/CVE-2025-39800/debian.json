  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: abort transaction on unexpected eb generation at btrfs_copy_root()  If we find an unexpected generation for the extent buffer we are cloning at btrfs_copy_root(), we just WARN_ON() and don't error out and abort the transaction, meaning we allow to persist metadata with an unexpected generation. Instead of warning only, abort the transaction and return -EUCLEAN.",
