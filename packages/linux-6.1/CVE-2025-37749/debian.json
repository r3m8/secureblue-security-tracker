  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data on ppp_sync_txmung  Ensure we have enough data in linear buffer from skb before accessing initial bytes. This prevents potential out-of-bounds accesses when processing short packets.  When ppp_sync_txmung receives an incoming package with an empty payload: (remote) gef\u27a4  p *(struct pppoe_hdr *) (skb->head + skb->network_header) $18 = { \ttype = 0x1, \tver = 0x1, \tcode = 0x0, \tsid = 0x2,         length = 0x0, \ttag = 0xffff8880371cdb96 }  from the skb struct (trimmed)       tail = 0x16,       end = 0x140,       head = 0xffff88803346f400 \"4\",       data = 0xffff88803346f416 \":\\377\",       truesize = 0x380,       len = 0x0,       data_len = 0x0,       mac_len = 0xe,       hdr_len = 0x0,  it is not safe to access data[2].
