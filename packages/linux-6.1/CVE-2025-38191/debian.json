  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix null pointer dereference in destroy_previous_session  If client set ->PreviousSessionId on kerberos session setup stage, NULL pointer dereference error will happen. Since sess->user is not set yet, It can pass the user argument as NULL to destroy_previous_session. sess->user will be set in ksmbd_krb5_authenticate(). So this patch move calling destroy_previous_session() after ksmbd_krb5_authenticate().",
