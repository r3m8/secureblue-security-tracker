  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: gadget: check that event count does not exceed event buffer length  The event count is read from register DWC3_GEVNTCOUNT. There is a check for the count being zero, but not for exceeding the event buffer length. Check that event count does not exceed event buffer length, avoiding an out-of-bounds access when memcpy'ing the event. Crash log: Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffc0129be000 pc : __memcpy+0x114/0x180 lr : dwc3_check_event_buf+0xec/0x348 x3 : 0000000000000030 x2 : 000000000000dfc4 x1 : ffffffc0129be000 x0 : ffffff87aad60080 Call trace: __memcpy+0x114/0x180 dwc3_interrupt+0x24/0x34",
