  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pwm: mediatek: Prevent divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config()  With CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST && !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, pwm_mediatek_config() has a divide-by-zero in the following line:  \tdo_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc->clk_pwms[pwm->hwpwm]));  due to the fact that the !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK version of clk_get_rate() returns zero.  This is presumably just a theoretical problem: COMPILE_TEST overrides the dependency on RALINK which would select COMMON_CLK.  Regardless it's a good idea to check for the error explicitly to avoid divide-by-zero.  Fixes the following warning:    drivers/pwm/pwm-mediatek.o: warning: objtool: .text: unexpected end of section  [ukleinek: s/CONFIG_CLK/CONFIG_HAVE_CLK/]",
