  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: limit printed string from FW file  There's no guarantee here that the file is always with a NUL-termination, so reading the string may read beyond the end of the TLV. If that's the last TLV in the file, it can perhaps even read beyond the end of the file buffer.  Fix that by limiting the print format to the size of the buffer we have.",
