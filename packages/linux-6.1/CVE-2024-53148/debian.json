  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: Flush partial mappings in error case  If some remap_pfn_range() calls succeeded before one failed, we still have buffer pages mapped into the userspace page tables when we drop the buffer reference with comedi_buf_map_put(bm). The userspace mappings are only cleaned up later in the mmap error path.  Fix it by explicitly flushing all mappings in our VMA on the error path.  See commit 79a61cc3fc04 (\"mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case\").",
