  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration  A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the same time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio->mapping should be NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.  In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page cache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index entry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/  Note: In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() && folio_test_swapcache() is used to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in swap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since !folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL.  But fortunately, its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY when folio->mapping is NULL.  So no need to take care of it here.",
