  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet:fix NPE during rx_complete  Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path. The usb_submit_urb function lacks a usbnet_going_away validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check.  This inconsistency creates a race condition where: A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding SKB data fails to be queued.  Subsequent processes: (e.g., rx_complete \u2192 defer_bh \u2192 __skb_unlink(skb, list)) attempt to access skb->next, triggering a NULL pointer dereference (Kernel Panic).",
