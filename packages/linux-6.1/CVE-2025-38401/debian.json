  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mtk-sd: Prevent memory corruption from DMA map failure  If msdc_prepare_data() fails to map the DMA region, the request is not prepared for data receiving, but msdc_start_data() proceeds the DMA with previous setting. Since this will lead a memory corruption, we have to stop the request operation soon after the msdc_prepare_data() fails to prepare it.",
