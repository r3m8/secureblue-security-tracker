  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled  A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes a device-by-zero error in the driver, leading to either a crash or an out of bounds read.  Prevent this by aborting the handling in ath9k_htc_swba() if beacons are not enabled.",
