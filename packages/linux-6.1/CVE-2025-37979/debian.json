  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: qcom: Fix sc7280 lpass potential buffer overflow  Case values introduced in commit 5f78e1fb7a3e (\"ASoC: qcom: Add driver support for audioreach solution\") cause out of bounds access in arrays of sc7280 driver data (e.g. in case of RX_CODEC_DMA_RX_0 in sc7280_snd_hw_params()).  Redefine LPASS_MAX_PORTS to consider the maximum possible port id for q6dsp as sc7280 driver utilizes some of those values.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
