  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()  If an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().  If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or lock_task_sighand() will fail.  Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.  This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail anyway in this case.",
