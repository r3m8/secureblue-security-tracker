  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ila: block BH in ila_output()  As explained in commit 1378817486d6 (\"tipc: block BH before using dst_cache\"), net/core/dst_cache.c helpers need to be called with BH disabled.  ila_output() is called from lwtunnel_output() possibly from process context, and under rcu_read_lock().  We might be interrupted by a softirq, re-enter ila_output() and corrupt dst_cache data structures.  Fix the race by using local_bh_disable().",
