  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPICA: Refuse to evaluate a method if arguments are missing  As reported in [1], a platform firmware update that increased the number of method parameters and forgot to update a least one of its callers, caused ACPICA to crash due to use-after-free.  Since this a result of a clear AML issue that arguably cannot be fixed up by the interpreter (it cannot produce missing data out of thin air), address it by making ACPICA refuse to evaluate a method if the caller attempts to pass fewer arguments than expected to it.",
