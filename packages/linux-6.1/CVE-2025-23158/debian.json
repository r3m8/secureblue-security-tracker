  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus: hfi: add check to handle incorrect queue size  qsize represents size of shared queued between driver and video firmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In such situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually available. Since new_wr_idx is not checked, so the following code will result in an OOB write. ... qsize = qhdr->q_size  if (wr_idx >= rd_idx)  empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx) .... if (new_wr_idx < qsize) {  memcpy(wr_ptr, packet, dwords << 2) --> OOB write  Add check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size while reading and writing packets into the queue.",
