  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  software node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()  software_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element, so the property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes but that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check, and may cause OOB for malformed property.  Fix by using as OOB check '((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)'.",
