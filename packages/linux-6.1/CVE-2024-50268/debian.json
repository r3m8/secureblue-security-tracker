  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: fix potential out of bounds in ucsi_ccg_update_set_new_cam_cmd()  The \"*cmd\" variable can be controlled by the user via debugfs.  That means \"new_cam\" can be as high as 255 while the size of the uc->updated[] array is UCSI_MAX_ALTMODES (30).  The call tree is: ucsi_cmd() // val comes from simple_attr_write_xsigned() -> ucsi_send_command()    -> ucsi_send_command_common()       -> ucsi_run_command() // calls ucsi->ops->sync_control()          -> ucsi_ccg_sync_control()",
