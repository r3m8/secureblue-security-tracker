  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_reject: don't leak dst refcount for loopback packets  recent patches to add a WARN() when replacing skb dst entry found an old bug:  WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 skb_dst_check_unset include/linux/skbuff.h:1164 [inline] WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 skb_dst_set include/linux/skbuff.h:1210 [inline] WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 nf_reject_fill_skb_dst+0x2a4/0x330 net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv4.c:234 [..] Call Trace:  nf_send_unreach+0x17b/0x6e0 net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv4.c:325  nft_reject_inet_eval+0x4bc/0x690 net/netfilter/nft_reject_inet.c:27  expr_call_ops_eval net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:237 [inline]  ..  This is because blamed commit forgot about loopback packets. Such packets already have a dst_entry attached, even at PRE_ROUTING stage.  Instead of checking hook just check if the skb already has a route attached to it.",
