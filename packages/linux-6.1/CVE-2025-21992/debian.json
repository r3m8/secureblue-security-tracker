  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera  The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up an unresponsive sensor.    [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff   [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1, 2:1, 3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff  Add this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.",
