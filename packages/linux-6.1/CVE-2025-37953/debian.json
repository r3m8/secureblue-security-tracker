  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_htb: make htb_deactivate() idempotent  Alan reported a NULL pointer dereference in htb_next_rb_node() after we made htb_qlen_notify() idempotent.  It turns out in the following case it introduced some regression:  htb_dequeue_tree():   |-> fq_codel_dequeue()     |-> qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()       |-> htb_qlen_notify()         |-> htb_deactivate()   |-> htb_next_rb_node()   |-> htb_deactivate()  For htb_next_rb_node(), after calling the 1st htb_deactivate(), the clprio[prio]->ptr could be already set to  NULL, which means htb_next_rb_node() is vulnerable here.  For htb_deactivate(), although we checked qlen before calling it, in case of qlen==0 after qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog(), we may call it again which triggers the warning inside.  To fix the issues here, we need to:  1) Make htb_deactivate() idempotent, that is, simply return if we    already call it before. 2) Make htb_next_rb_node() safe against ptr==NULL.  Many thanks to Alan for testing and for the reproducer.",
