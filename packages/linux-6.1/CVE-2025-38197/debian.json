  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: dell_rbu: Fix list usage  Pass the correct list head to list_for_each_entry*() when looping through the packet list.  Without this patch, reading the packet data via sysfs will show the data incorrectly (because it starts at the wrong packet), and clearing the packet list will result in a NULL pointer dereference.",
