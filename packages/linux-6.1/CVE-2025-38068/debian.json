  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: lzo - Fix compression buffer overrun  Unlike the decompression code, the compression code in LZO never checked for output overruns.  It instead assumes that the caller always provides enough buffer space, disregarding the buffer length provided by the caller.  Add a safe compression interface that checks for the end of buffer before each write.  Use the safe interface in crypto/lzo.",
