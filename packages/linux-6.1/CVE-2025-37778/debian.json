  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate  krb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointer to NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise sess->user but that function may return without doing so. If that happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate, will be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess->user.",
