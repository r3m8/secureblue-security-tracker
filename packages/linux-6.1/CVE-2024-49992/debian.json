  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/stm: Avoid use-after-free issues with crtc and plane  ltdc_load() calls functions drm_crtc_init_with_planes(), drm_universal_plane_init() and drm_encoder_init(). These functions should not be called with parameters allocated with devm_kzalloc() to avoid use-after-free issues [1].  Use allocations managed by the DRM framework.
