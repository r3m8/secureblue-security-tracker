  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: virt: acrn: hsm: Use kzalloc to avoid info leak in pmcmd_ioctl  In the \"pmcmd_ioctl\" function, three memory objects allocated by kmalloc are initialized by \"hcall_get_cpu_state\", which are then copied to user space. The initializer is indeed implemented in \"acrn_hypercall2\" (arch/x86/include/asm/acrn.h). There is a risk of information leakage due to uninitialized bytes.",
