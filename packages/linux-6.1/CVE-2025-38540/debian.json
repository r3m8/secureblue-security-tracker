  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: quirks: Add quirk for 2 Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras  The Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras (USB ID 04F2:B824 & 04F2:B82C) report a HID sensor interface that is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up an unresponsive sensor.  Add these 2 devices to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.",
