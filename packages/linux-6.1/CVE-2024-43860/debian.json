  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  remoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULL  In imx_rproc_addr_init() \"nph = of_count_phandle_with_args()\" just counts number of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() in the parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced. Adjust this issue by adding NULL-return check.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.  [Fixed title to fit within the prescribed 70-75 charcters]",
