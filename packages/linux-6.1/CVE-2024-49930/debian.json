  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath11k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats  Currently, the ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However, the ath11k_dp_process_rx() function access ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO destination SRNG ring ID, which is incorrect. SRNG ring ID differ from normal ring ID, and this usage leads to out-of-bounds array access. To fix this issue, modify ath11k_dp_process_rx() to use the normal ring ID directly instead of the SRNG ring ID to avoid out-of-bounds array access.  Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01744-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
