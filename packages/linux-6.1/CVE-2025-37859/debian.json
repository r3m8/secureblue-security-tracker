  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  page_pool: avoid infinite loop to schedule delayed worker  We noticed the kworker in page_pool_release_retry() was waken up repeatedly and infinitely in production because of the buggy driver causing the inflight less than 0 and warning us in page_pool_inflight()[1].  Since the inflight value goes negative, it means we should not expect the whole page_pool to get back to work normally.  This patch mitigates the adverse effect by not rescheduling the kworker when detecting the inflight negative in page_pool_release_retry().
