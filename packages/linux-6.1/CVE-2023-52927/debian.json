  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: allow exp not to be removed in nf_ct_find_expectation  Currently nf_conntrack_in() calling nf_ct_find_expectation() will remove the exp from the hash table. However, in some scenario, we expect the exp not to be removed when the created ct will not be confirmed, like in OVS and TC conntrack in the following patches.  This patch allows exp not to be removed by setting IPS_CONFIRMED in the status of the tmpl.",
