  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lock  When netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holding kmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lock inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to __alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire kmemleak_lock.  This is the path for the deadlock.  mem_pool_alloc()   -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);       -> pr_warn_once()           -> netconsole subsystem \t     -> netpoll \t         -> __alloc_skb \t\t   -> __create_object \t\t     -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);  Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() after kmemleak_lock is released.",
