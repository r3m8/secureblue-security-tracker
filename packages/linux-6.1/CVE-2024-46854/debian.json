  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN  When sending packets under 60 bytes, up to three bytes of the buffer following the data may be leaked. Avoid this by extending all packets to ETH_ZLEN, ensuring nothing is leaked in the padding. This bug can be reproduced by running  \t$ ping -s 11 destination",
