  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: call cache_put if xdr_reserve_space returns NULL  If not enough buffer space available, but idmap_lookup has triggered lookup_fn which calls cache_get and returns successfully. Then we missed to call cache_put here which pairs with cache_get.  Reviwed-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>",
