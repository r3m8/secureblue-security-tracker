  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write  After nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is still attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to nfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the page group. The reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't necessarily have a lock on the page group head.  So in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in nfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the request in nfs_inode_remove_request().",
