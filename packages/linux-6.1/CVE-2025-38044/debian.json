  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: cx231xx: set device_caps for 417  The video_device for the MPEG encoder did not set device_caps.  Add this, otherwise the video device can't be registered (you get a WARN_ON instead).  Not seen before since currently 417 support is disabled, but I found this while experimenting with it.",
