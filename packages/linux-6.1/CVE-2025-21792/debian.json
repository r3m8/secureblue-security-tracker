  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: Fix refcount leak caused by setting SO_BINDTODEVICE sockopt  If an AX25 device is bound to a socket by setting the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option, a refcount leak will occur in ax25_release().  Commit 9fd75b66b8f6 (\"ax25: Fix refcount leaks caused by ax25_cb_del()\") added decrement of device refcounts in ax25_release(). In order for that to work correctly the refcounts must already be incremented when the device is bound to the socket. An AX25 device can be bound to a socket by either calling ax25_bind() or setting SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option. In both cases the refcounts should be incremented, but in fact it is done only in ax25_bind().  This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:  ================================================================ refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.
