  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ppp: fix memory leak in pad_compress_skb  If alloc_skb() fails in pad_compress_skb(), it returns NULL without releasing the old skb. The caller does:      skb = pad_compress_skb(ppp, skb);     if (!skb)         goto drop;  drop:     kfree_skb(skb);  When pad_compress_skb() returns NULL, the reference to the old skb is lost and kfree_skb(skb) ends up doing nothing, leading to a memory leak.  Align pad_compress_skb() semantics with realloc(): only free the old skb if allocation and compression succeed.  At the call site, use the new_skb variable so the original skb is not lost when pad_compress_skb() fails.",
