  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-cgroup: Fix class @block_class's subsystem refcount leakage  blkcg_fill_root_iostats() iterates over @block_class's devices by class_dev_iter_(init|next)(), but does not end iterating with class_dev_iter_exit(), so causes the class's subsystem refcount leakage.  Fix by ending the iterating with class_dev_iter_exit().",
