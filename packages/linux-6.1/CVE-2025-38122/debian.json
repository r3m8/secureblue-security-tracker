  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gve: add missing NULL check for gve_alloc_pending_packet() in TX DQO  gve_alloc_pending_packet() can return NULL, but gve_tx_add_skb_dqo() did not check for this case before dereferencing the returned pointer.  Add a missing NULL check to prevent a potential NULL pointer dereference when allocation fails.  This improves robustness in low-memory scenarios.",
