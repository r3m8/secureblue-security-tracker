  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hns3: make sure ptp clock is unregister and freed if hclge_ptp_get_cycle returns an error  During the initialization of ptp, hclge_ptp_get_cycle might return an error and returned directly without unregister clock and free it. To avoid that, call hclge_ptp_destroy_clock to unregist and free clock if hclge_ptp_get_cycle failed.",
