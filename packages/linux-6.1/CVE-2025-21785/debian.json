  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: cacheinfo: Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array  The loop that detects/populates cache information already has a bounds check on the array size but does not account for cache levels with separate data/instructions cache. Fix this by incrementing the index for any populated leaf (instead of any populated level).",
