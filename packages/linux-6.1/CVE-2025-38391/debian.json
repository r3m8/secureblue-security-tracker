  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: do not index invalid pin_assignments  A poorly implemented DisplayPort Alt Mode port partner can indicate that its pin assignment capabilities are greater than the maximum value, DP_PIN_ASSIGN_F. In this case, calls to pin_assignment_show will cause a BRK exception due to an out of bounds array access.  Prevent for loop in pin_assignment_show from accessing invalid values in pin_assignments by adding DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAX value in typec_dp.h and using i < DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAX as a loop condition.",
