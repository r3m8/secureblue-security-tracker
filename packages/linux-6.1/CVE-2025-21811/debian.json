  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active references  nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers(), which iterates through the buffers attached to dirty data folios/pages, accesses the attached buffers without locking the folios/pages.  For data cache, nilfs_clear_folio_dirty() may be called asynchronously when the file system degenerates to read only, so nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() still has the potential to cause use after free issues when buffers lose the protection of their dirty state midway due to this asynchronous clearing and are unintentionally freed by try_to_free_buffers().  Eliminate this race issue by adjusting the lock section in this function.",
