  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nbd: don't allow reconnect after disconnect  Following process can cause nbd_config UAF:  1) grab nbd_config temporarily;  2) nbd_genl_disconnect() flush all recv_work() and release the initial reference:    nbd_genl_disconnect    nbd_disconnect_and_put     nbd_disconnect      flush_workqueue(nbd->recv_workq)     if (test_and_clear_bit(NBD_RT_HAS_CONFIG_REF, ...))      nbd_config_put      -> due to step 1), reference is still not zero  3) nbd_genl_reconfigure() queue recv_work() again;    nbd_genl_reconfigure    config = nbd_get_config_unlocked(nbd)    if (!config)    -> succeed    if (!test_bit(NBD_RT_BOUND, ...))    -> succeed    nbd_reconnect_socket     queue_work(nbd->recv_workq, &args->work)  4) step 1) release the reference;  5) Finially, recv_work() will trigger UAF:    recv_work    nbd_config_put(nbd)    -> nbd_config is freed    atomic_dec(&config->recv_threads)    -> UAF  Fix the problem by clearing NBD_RT_BOUND in nbd_genl_disconnect(), so that nbd_genl_reconfigure() will fail.",
