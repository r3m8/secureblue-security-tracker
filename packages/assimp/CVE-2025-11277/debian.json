  "description": "A weakness has been identified in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 6.0.2. This affects the function Q3DImporter::InternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/Q3D/Q3DLoader.cpp. Executing manipulation can lead to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be launched locally. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited.",
