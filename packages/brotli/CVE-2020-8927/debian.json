  "description": "A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker controlling the input length of a \"one-shot\" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the \"streaming\" API as opposed to the \"one-shot\" API, and impose chunk size limits.",
