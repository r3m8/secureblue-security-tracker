  "description": "When using Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), Secure stack  contents can be leaked to Non-secure state via floating-point registers  when a Secure to Non-secure function call is made that returns a  floating-point value and when this is the first use of floating-point  since entering Secure state. This allows an attacker to read a limited  quantity of Secure stack contents with an impact on confidentiality.  This issue is specific to code generated using LLVM-based compilers.",
