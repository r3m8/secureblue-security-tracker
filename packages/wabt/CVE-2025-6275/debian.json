  "description": "A vulnerability was found in WebAssembly wabt up to 1.0.37. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function GetFuncOffset of the file src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. A similar issue reported during the same timeframe was disputed by the code maintainer because it might not affect \"real world wasm programs\". Therefore, this entry might get disputed as well in the future.",
