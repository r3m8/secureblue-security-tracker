  "description": "A vulnerability was found in WebAssembly wabt up to 1.0.37. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function OnDataCount of the file src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc. The manipulation leads to resource consumption. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. A similar issue reported during the same timeframe was disputed by the code maintainer because it might not affect \"real world wasm programs\". Therefore, this entry might get disputed as well in the future.",
