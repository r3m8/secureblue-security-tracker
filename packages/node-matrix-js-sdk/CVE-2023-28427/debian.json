  "description": "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
