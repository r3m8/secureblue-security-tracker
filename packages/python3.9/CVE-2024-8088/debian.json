  "description": "There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython \"zipfile\" module affecting \"zipfile.Path\". Note that the more common API \"zipfile.ZipFile\" class is unaffected.      When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods of \"zipfile.Path\" like \"namelist()\", \"iterdir()\", etc) the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling user-controlled zip archives are not affected.",
