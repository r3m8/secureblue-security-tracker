  "description": "A defect was discovered in the Python \u201cssl\u201d module where there is a memory race condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods \u201ccert_store_stats()\u201d and \u201cget_ca_certs()\u201d. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are called at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext, such as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured. This issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.",
