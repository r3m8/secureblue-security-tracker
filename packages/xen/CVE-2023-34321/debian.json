  "description": "Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.  Unfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would then result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.",
