  "description": "Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability.     Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the  developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed  macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro  is executed.  Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.   This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.",
