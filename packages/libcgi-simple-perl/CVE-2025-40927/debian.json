  "description": "CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting\u00a0flaw in CGI::Simple\u00a0that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.    As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.  Impact  By injecting %0A\u00a0(newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:    *  Break the current HTTP header   *  Inject a new header or entire body   *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server\u2019s response That can lead to the following attacks:    *  reflected XSS   *  open redirect   *  cache poisoning   *  header manipulation",
