  "description": "ACE vulnerability in conditional configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core up to and including version 1.5.18 in Java applications, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by compromising an existing logback configuration file or by injecting an environment variable before program execution.    A successful attack requires the presence of Janino library and Spring Framework to be present on the user's class path. In addition, the attacker must\u00a0 have write access to a  configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious  environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both  cases, the attack requires existing privilege.",
