{
  "description": "Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes \u201clocalhost6\u201d. When \u201clocalhost6\u201d is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the \u201clocalhost6\u201d domain. As long as the attacker uses the \u201clocalhost6\u201d domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.",
